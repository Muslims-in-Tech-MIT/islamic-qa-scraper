      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: Assalamu Alaykum,\n1. The brother who was slaughtering my goat did not realize that the blade was not sharp enough, until after the blade had already cut into the goat, so he continued with it. Does this make the meat of this animal impermissible?\n2. Also, does the one slaughtering have to mention the name of Allah, or can a Christian slaughter the animal, while a Muslim standing with him mentions the name of Allah instead?\nAnswer: Wa alaykum as salam wa rahmatullah,\n1. As long as the blade could cut through the skin, it will be permissible to eat.  It is highly encouraged to have the blade be sharp, as it will prevent undue suffering of the animal. \n2. For a Muslim, it is an obligation to mention the Name of Allah.  For a person of the Book (Ahlul Kitab), it is not an obligation to mention the Name of Allah.

      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: Assalamu Alaykum,\nConcerning shoes with pig leather: if you have to touch the shoe to take the outer cover off, would that break your wudu?\nIt is quite difficult to find shoes without pigskin and I’m going a little OCD about this. What should I do?\nAnswer: Wa alaykum as salam wa rahmatullah,\nIt is not permissible for a person to use, wear or sell pig skin in the Maliki school.  Touching pig skin does not break wudu in any situation.  If a portion of the pig leather got on one’s body or clothes, that would have to be removed before prayer. \nIf you are not sure whether leather is from pig or not, it is considered pure until proven impure.  If you find that you are experiencing “OCD” or waswasa, it is an obligation to do whatever is needed to remove those constant thoughts.

Not from the the obligatory nor the emphasized sunnahs. It is recited silently prior to bowing (ruku’) in the obligatory prayer of Subh not the Witr nor the Sunnah of Fajr. [Dardir: Sharh Saghir]\nIf one forgets the Qunut prior to the ruku’ there is no problem in reciting it after raising from ruku’ prior to prostrating (sujud). However, one does not leave ruku’ and return to the standing position in order to recite it otherwise the prayer is invalidated.

Is my fast valid? Do I need to make ghusl?\nAnswer: Wa alaikum assalam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh,\nAccording to the Maliki school, if a person does not intend sexual thoughts but has a release of some fluid while fasting (such as madhy or many), the fast is valid. If sexual thoughts or touching was intended and there was a release of fluid, then the fast would not be valid.\nIn terms of the ghusl, the only time that it is obligatory is if there is the:\n1) discharge of sexual fluid (many)\n2) associated with pleasure\n3) that is normal.\nIf any of these three aspects are absent, then there is no ghusl (full body shower) that is required. As an example, if a person has the release of fluid without pleasure then no ghusl is required. Or, if a person has pleasure but no release of fluid then ghusl is not required. Or, if there is fluid released and there was pleasure, but it was an abnormal situation (like the sting of a scorpion), then no ghusl is required.

      "Question": "Are the Urine, Feces and Vomit of a Baby Filthy According to the Maliki School?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Ustadh Tariq Abdul-Rasheed\nQuestion: Do the urine, stool, vomit etc of a baby count as najasa in the maliki madhab? The baby is both breast fed and formula fed. \nAnswer: In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful, and blessings and peace upon our master Muhammad, his family, companions and those who follow their noble way.\nAs salaamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh,\nImpurity of Urine and Feces\nUrine and feces are both considered impure in the Maliki school whether from a child or an adult. [Hashiya Dusuqi]\nPurity of Vomit and Burping (Belching)\nVomit is considered pure unless the color, taste or smell of it has changed from the original state of food after having been settled in the stomach. This is usually discernible if the vomit has acidified and/or has a foul odor. Vomit would also be considered impure if it resembles feces [Hashiya Dusuqi]\nBurping accompanied with food or liquid (known as qalas) is considered pure unless it resembles feces. [Hashiya Dusuqi]\nThe difference between vomit and burping is that vomit is what is forced up from the stomach after having settled in the stomach. Whereas, burping accompanied with food or liquid is what is forced up from the stomach as a result of a full stomach. However, the food or drink never actually settles in the stomach.\nDispensation from removing filth for mothers and wet-nurses\nDue to the difficulty of remaining free from filth while nursing a child the scholars have allowed a dispensation for nursing mothers and wet nurses. Meaning that if due precaution is taken to prevent impurities from reaching the body and clothes when the child urinates or defecates it is recommended and not obligatory to remove the filth (from the body or clothing) if it is excessive (even if she sees the filth).\nThis ruling also applies if she is in doubt about whether or not filth is on her body or clothing. That is, she is not obliged nor is it recommended to sprinkle water on her body or clothing if she has doubts about filth being on them.\nFinally, it is recommended for her to have a separate set of clothes for prayer but not obligatory. [Hashiya Dusuqi]\nThis dispensation is based on the following verses of the Holy Quran and is the well-known opinion of the Maliki school:\n“He has chosen you and has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty.” [Surah Hajj: 78]\n“Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity.” [Surah Baqarah: 286]\n“For indeed, with hardship [will be] ease.” [Surah Sharh: 5]\nBaraka Allahu feekum and Allah knows best.\nTariq Abdul-Rasheed\n\nOriginal Source Link\n",

      "Question": "Frequent Rectal Discharges: Is There Any Dispensation Regarding Maintaining Ritual Purity? [Maliki School]",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Ustadh Tariq Abdul-Rasheed\nQuestion: I have several questions, if someone could please answer according to Maliki fiqh.\n1) Sometimes when I am stressed I get hemorrhoids, and (even after istinja) some filth and blood can periodically exit my anus. Does this break my wudhu? I do not see any filth on my clothes; is it still necessary for me to wash them before I pray?\n2) When I do not masturbate at least about once a week, then I get a thin clear watery discharge from my anus whenever the slightest sexual thought passes through my mind (even when the thoughts are unintentional). Does this break my wudhu? Do I need to wash my clothes to pray?\n3) When I do not masturbate for many days, then I would get an erection without any sexual thought and the erection is enough to cause (not only a small anal discharge, but also) some mady to exit.And it becomes difficult to wash off the mady from my underwear before every prayer. Is there any falicitation?\nAnswer: In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful, and blessings and peace upon our master Muhammad, his family, companions and those who follow their noble way.\nWa alaikum salaam wa rahmatullahi wa barkatuh,\nMay Allah (Most High) facilitate and make easy your situation.\nBasis for Facilitation and Dispensation\nIncontinence (salas) whether it be from urine, feces, menstrual irregularity or the like are causes for dispensation in the Maliki school. This is based on the following verse of the Quran:\n“He has chosen you and has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty.” [Surah Hajj: 87]\n“Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity.” [Surah Baqarah: 286]\n“For indeed, with hardship [will be] ease.” [Surah Sharh: 5]\nIt is also based on well-known and agreed upon general principles such, “Hardship shall bring alleviation” and “If a matter becomes restricted it expands”.\nDistinguishing between Removing Impurities and What Nullifies Wudu\nThe scholars of the Maliki school distinguish between the exiting of impurities from the front and rear private parts as a result of incontinence in two ways:\na. As it relates to the ruling of removing impurities from one’s body and clothing (izalat an-najasah).\nb. As it relates to the ruling of vitiating or invalidating wudu as a result of impurities exiting the private parts (nawāqid al-wudu).\nShaykh Nafrawi mentions in his commentary on Risālah of Imam Ibn Abi Zayd the reason for this distinction has to do with the lightness [of the rulings] related to removing impurities whereas purification from minor ritual impurity is a point a consensus. [Nafrawi: al-Fawaqih al-Dawani]\nFor this reason, Imam Sāwī states, “What is [intended] here [meaning the chapter on removing impurities] concerns what is related to removing impurities and there [in the chapter of what nullifies wudu] relates to that. Whereas, [the legal ruling of] impurities are easier than those of nullification of wudu [as will be seen] in what follows.”[Sawi: Bulgat as-Sālik]\nThis is a subtle and important point that might otherwise be overlooked in understanding the legal ruling of these issues in the Maliki school.\nConditions for eligibility of the dispensation:\nIn order for one to take this dispensation it is important to note the following conditions.\na. The exiting of impurities occurs once per day or more. If it exits some days and not others this does not warrant the dispensation.\nb. The condition is chronic and has no immediate cure. Otherwise it becomes an obligation to get treatment and the dispensation is only allowed during the period of treatment.\nDetails of the Rulings\nHemorrhoids and Rectal Discharge: impurities that exit as a result of hemorrhoids are overlooked (ma’fu ‘anhu) if it occurs at least once a day or more. This is the well-know position of the school and therefore one is not obliged to remove the impurities from the body or clothing due to the hardship. [Dardir: Sharh Saghir]\nDo the impurities that exit as a result of hemorrhoids nullify wudu? If the impurities exit unpredictably and irregularly during most or all of the prayer times the ruling is that it does not vitiate wudu. However, it is encouraged (mustahabb) to make wudu for each prayer. [Dardir: Sharh Sagir]\nAn example of this would be: on Monday impurities exit just as Thuhr enters. Whereas, on Tuesday it exits toward the end of Thuhr. Similarly on Tuesday more impurities exit mid-way through the time for Asr. On Wednesday impurities exit during the time of Asr and again at Maghrib.\nThe idea here is that there is no identifiable predictability to the time of its exiting and that it occurs throughout the day during most of the prayer times. Otherwise, if the times are predictable the ruling changes and one is required (wajib) to either hasten or delay the prayer based on the timings associated with the discharge of impurities.\nAn example of this would be: if it is known that the discharge occurs every day during the first time or preferred time (ikhtiyari) of Thuhr but does not exit during the necessary time (daruri), in this case it is obligatory to delay the prayer to the daruri time and make wudu for the prayer. The opposite would be true.\nMadhi (pre-ejaculatory fluid): as it relates to removing pre-ejaculatory fluid (i.e. from the body and clothing) that exits irregularly it takes the ruling of hemorrhoids as mentioned above if it occurs once or more per day. [Dardir: Sharh Saghir]\nHowever, the ruling concerning madhi nullifying wudu is stricter. If the madhi occurs as a result of celibacy, looking at what causes arousal or constant sexual thoughts it nullifies wudu without exception. Whereas, if the madhi exits as a result of illness or other physical condition without any apparent cause such as sexual thoughts or looking. In this case it does not nullify wudu similar to the ruling of hemorrhoids mentioned above and it is recommended to make wudu for each prayer. [Dardir: Sharh Saghir]\nIf it is unclear and madhi exits both; as a result of celibacy, sexual thoughts or the like thereof and it also exits randomly without any apparent cause. It would be from cautiousness to consider it as nullifying wudu.\nThe Upshot\nDue to the complexity of your situation it is important to take note not to mix between the issues. The hemorrhoids, as you mentioned, are a daily and generally persistent problem occurring at various times throughout the day. Based on what has been mentioned you are not obliged to remove the impurities nor does it invalidate your wudu.\nAs for the madhi, you will need to ascertain if it is a daily problem. If it does not occur daily you are obliged to remove it from your body and clothing and it nullifies your wudu. (Even if you don’t have to remove the impurities from the rectal discharge.)\nIf it does occur daily but due to sexual thoughts or celibacy, in this case, you are not obliged to remove it from your body and clothing but it does nullify wudu. If madhi exits daily without cause, in this case, you are not obliged to remove it from your body and clothes and it does not nullify your wudu.\nTake care to treat each issue accordingly.\nAllah (Most High) knows best.\nTariq Abdul-Rasheed\n\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Will a Believer Who Doesn’t Practice Islam Go to Paradise?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: If someone who doesn’t pray salah, doesn’t give zakat, doesn’t fast basically he doesn’t do anything Islamic, would that person ever enter paradise?\nAnswer: Allah forgives all sins except associating partners with Him.\nIf a person’s final state was that he or she was a believer, it is possible that they are forgiven for all their sins. Allah says, “Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less that that for whom He wills” (Quran 4:48).\nForgiveness is Up to Allah\nThus, regardless of the sins of a person, as long as they were a believer, it is possible that they can be forgiven. This is referred to as a person being in the “mashe’ah”, which means it is up to Allah whether or not to punish them. But, if a person left this life without faith in Allah, then the cannot be forgiven, as the verse mentions.\nDeeds Are By Their Final Action\nOne thing to point out is that a Muslim should never rely solely on the hope that they will leave this life with belief, and thus be forgiven for all their sins. There is no guarantee of that a person who professes the belief in Allah will die with that belief. In a Hadith narrated by Bukhari and Muslim, and listed by Nawawi in his 40 Hadith collection.\n“By the One, other than Whom there is no deity, verily one of you performs the actions of the people of Paradise until there is but an arm’s length between him and it. Then that which is written overtakes him, and so he acts with the actions of the people of the Hellfire and thus enters it.”\nImam Nawawi, in his commentary on his 40 Hadith collection says that this is a proof that we cannot be guaranteed that a specific person will enter Paradise. The only people that we can say that are those who Allah or His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) stated where in Paradise. The same Hadith prevents us from guaranteeing any specific person is going to Hell, unless we have revelation to prove that.\nAnd Allah knows best.\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Did Allah Deny Me a Job Because of My Sins?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: I had had unlawful intercourse with two women. I was in love with two other girls also. But we broke up and one of them is blaming me and saying that I hurt her. Then, I noticed that I didn’t got a job even though I had many opportunities. Is she the reason behind that? Now I stopped doing all those things and I made tawba. Will I get a job now?\nAnswer: You should make a sincere repentance (tawbah nasuha) for the sin that you fell into. This requires that you 1) Stop the Action, 2) Firmly intend and resolve to never go back to that sin, 3) Have sincere remorse over what you did.\nYou should remind yourself that sometimes we do things to others and that will sometimes come around and hurt us in a similar way. Just as you would never want someone to fornicate (zina) with your sister, mother, aunt or daughter, then you too should not commit zina with the daughter or sister of another man.\nIn terms of why you are not getting the job, Allah knows best the reason. A job is from the sustenance (rizq) that is written for us. Why something is written or not written is known to Allah alone.\nWhat we can say is that fear of God (taqwa) can increase your sustenance and sins can decrease your sustenance. So it may be the sins that you did are preventing you from the job. But only Allah knows.\nYou must work towards having more taqwa of Allah and follow His commands. Establish the five daily prayers regularly and properly with correct washing (tahara). To do this you must study how to properly prepare for the prayer (wudu, removing filth, ghusl, etc) and how to perform the prayer.\nYou should study accepted books with qualified teachers. You can also study through our website online for free to know these rules. If you perform the prayer properly, it will prevent you from committing fornication (zina) again.\nRami Nsour\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "How to Approach Getting Married",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: I’m 31 years old and still not married. My younger sister and younger brother are married which stressed me out. Also, I have two suitors who I’m not interested in due to age, maturity and religiosity. I know that I won’t find a perfect guy but when I pray istikhara I didn’t feel anything. \nMy parents won’t decide for me. They just tell me the guy’s name, and sometimes no details at all. I’m totally lost. How can I make decision without some details about the guy and just some basic information for example their name, age, occupation?\nSometimes, my father just chast with them after they come to the house then asks me do I want to accept them. Some of them ask if I’m willing to get know the man thru sms/email/phone first. I’m against this as I tried it once and I know I’m not good at it and I don’t like to have useless chatting with boys. Please advise me.\n \nAnswer:\nMarriage is From your Provision (rizq)\nThe first thing to remember when approaching marriage is that it is part of your provision (rizq) which is guaranteed by Allah.  Allah says, “There is not a single creature on the earth except that Allah takes care of it’s provision” [Quran 11:6].  So, no matter how old or young one is, their wealth or whether or their siblings married before them, these and other factors do not affect the provision that is guaranteed.\nDepending on Allah\nAlthough we know to depend on Allah for provision, He also instructed us to take the necessary means to achieve the provisions.  True depending on Allah (tawakkul) is defined as “taking the necessary means while recognizing that Allah is the true provider” [Mawlud, Purification of the Heart].  So in the case of quenching our thirst, for example, we don’t just wait for it to be quenched, we drink water as a means and recognize that Allah quenches our thirst not the water.\nTying the Camel\nAnas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that a person asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), “Should I tie my camel and have Tawakkul (trust in Allah for her protection) or should I leave her untied and have Tawakkul.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) replied, “Tie her and have Tawakkul” [Jami At-Tirmidhi].\nGetting to Know Someone\nBefore getting married, one should take the means to get to know the person.  The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) encouraged one of the Sahaba to look at a woman before marrying her [Ahmed and others].  The reason for this is that there are traits a person may have in their personality or body that might complicate a strong relationship from forming.\nThe Limits of Interaction for non-Mahram\nAs long as one follows the rules of gender interaction, they can communicate with a potential suitor to ensure that there is compatibility. A woman can speak to a non-mahram as long as they do not maintain constant gaze at each other, there is no flirting, and their is no pleasure being derived from the voice or conversation [Mawlud, Prohibitions of the Tongue].  The two also must be in plain sight of other as to avoid the prohibition of being alone together (khalwa) and there cannot be any physical contact. Just as one can keep a conversation “strictly business” in a school or work environment, the same can be applied to a conversation about marriage.\nRami\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Is Someone Using Black Magic to Destroy My Marriage?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: I hope this reaches you in the best of health and imaan. I got married a few months ago and everything was at first, but then my husband started arguing with me about petty things constantly. He’s gotten very ill, suffering from back, arm, knee, shoulder pain, headaches, lack of intimacy, lack of appetite, mood swings etc.\n \nHe acts harsh towards me and threatens me with divorce.  He says he doesn’t know why he is unhappy with me, because at other times he says I’m the perfect wife. The doctors don’t even know exactly what is wrong with him.\nRecently I’ve been getting dreams of jinns trying to wrestle with me whilst I’m  in bed etc, then I’ve woken up  feeling shaken because it was so real. I even had another dream where I woke suddenly because I felt like there was some  dark male figure  hugging me whilst laying besides me on the left hand side of the bed. (I was not sharing a bed with my husband at the time) The figure was hot. I awoke feeling shaken again. Now I always read ayatul kursi and the 4 quls before going to bed.\n \nI  had another dream where my mother had asked me who had given me these gifts she found in my room. I answered her and asked her why it was important? She said the gifts indicated that someone had ”done something to me”.  I’m just frustrated, upset, confused now I was wondering if this relates to  my marriage? I feel like someone is doing magic to interfere in our marriage. I’m not sure. Is there anyway of really finding out?\n \nPlease advise me about what I can do to find out if something is going on  and what I can do in the meantime to protect our marriage and help my husband.\n\nAnswer: There is no exact way of finding out for sure what is going on.  There is a chance that it could be related to something on the unseen realm, such as jinn or magic, and there is also the chance that it could be a mental health issue or emotional issue that he is dealing with.\nWhat I would suggest is that you cover all the bases in trying to treat what is going on.  Continue to do what you are doing in terms of Quran recitation and dhikr.\nYou should also increase the amount of whatever you are doing as long as it is within your capacity, as moderation is also prescribed.  You should encourage your husband to increase his acts of worship and to be in the company of good people and shuyukh, as that has a healing effect.\nAlso remember that there is a lot of good found in seeking knowledge and a special protection granted to seekers of knowledge, so you and your husband should make a serious effort to seek knowledge.  His emotions may be coming from ignorance of the deen and the cure for this is to study.\nYou should also seek outside help from both clinicians/therapists as well as people trained in spiritual matters.  See if there are any therapists that can help you and your husband understand the possibilities of what might be going on.  In terms of people versed in spiritual matters, you should only go to people who are knowledgeable of the Quran and Sunna and are know for following the tenets of the faith.\nBeware of charlatans, people who are not qualified and those who seeking money for this type of work.  Having a knowledgeable teacher locally or by phone will also be a help for you and your husband to work through issues that you are having as a couple or spiritual issues.  They may also be able to identify signs of what might possibly be the cause of what your husband is experiencing.\nAnd Allah knows best.\nRami\nRelated Answers:\nHow to Counteract the Effects of Black Magic\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Balancing Confidence and Humility and the Wisdom of Trials from Allah",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion 1: How can we balance self-esteem with humility? To me self-esteem means one loves oneself and consider themselves to be mostly good, yet Islam requires us to consider ourselves weak, broken and full of faults. Is it ok to do ‘affirmations’ by looking in the mirror and repeating statements like ‘I am good’, ‘I am carefree and joyous’ etc. for 2 minutes a day? This is what some self-help non Muslim people recommend.\n \nAnswer 1: Before analyzing the various practices that one can do to improve their self esteem, it is important to note the Islamic understanding of how we view ourselves.\n The Islamic Understanding of Self-Esteem\nThere are terms to know and they are arrogance (kibr), vanity (‘ujb), dignity (‘izzah), debasement (dhul), and humility (tawadu’).  Knowing these terms and what the definition is is important so that one does not fall into the prohibited.  Arrogance (kibr) is when a person deems themselves to be good but in relation to others as in saying, “I am better than him/her/them.”\nVanity is when a person deems them self to have some blessing and forgets that it is from Allah and it does not require that a person is looking down on another person.  Dignity (‘izzah) is when a person recognizes the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon them (faith, life, health, beauty, wealth, knowledge, prestige, etc) and walks humbly with a recognition of those blessings while not deeming themselves better than others.\nIf a person allows others to walk over them and take away their rights, this is called dhul and it is haram. So you have to hold your head up high with dignity, not with arrogance.   All people have to remember that they have God-given rights and it is an obligation to protect their dignified state (muru’ah). If a person voluntarily gives up their owed rights and is not demanding, then this is humility (tawadu’) and it is a praiseworthy trait.\n \nA person must therefore protect his self-esteem especially since our greatest enemy, the Shaytan, who has declared war on mankind, hates our God-given dignity.  Allah says, “And we have ennobled the children of Adam.”  It was this honor, nobility and dignity that cause Iblis to refuse to bow and caused him to become rejected.  Iblis hates us for this and will try everything to remove our dignity.\nHe will make us remove our clothes, tattoo ourselves, wear undignified clothing, speak filth  hurt ourselves and others.  He works day an night to sink us into a state of depression and then into a state of despair.  In the state of despair, we end up hurting ourselves and others, leaving faith, and taking our lives or the lives of others.  So, we must have a fortress of strong self esteem to protect ourselves against the shaytan.\nMentioning the blessings that Allah has given us is actually a good practice.  In Sura Duha it states, “And as for the blessing of Allah then speak.”  At the same time, we do not want to allow a recognition of the blessings of Allah turn into arrogance or vanity.  One way to do this is to remind ourselves of our nature, which includes the fact that we carry najasah in our bodies, we create filth in our ears (wax), eyes (sleep), nose (mucous), mouths (saliva), etc.\nHasan al Basri once saw a man he did not know walking with arrogance   The many saw Hasan looking at him and said, “Do you know me?” to which Hasan al Basri said, “Yes, you began as a clot of blood, then at the end your life you become a rotten corpse and in between that you caryy filth in your body.”\nThe science of understanding the intricacies between all of these states is called Tassawuuf and is an accepted part of Ahlul Sunna wal Jama’ah.  I encourage you to study this science but to begin by gaining a firm grounding in the science of faith (aqida) and law (fiqh).\n \nQuestion 2: I understand that Allah tests us with suffering as a trial, but what if it is too much for the person to handle?  I suppose I am trying to ask how come we are tested in ways that we can be completely ignorant about? As a child I was beaten, tricked and nearly drowned by other children falsely accused by my parents for things, and told I was stupid.  Were these experiences supposed to benefit me in the long run?\nAnswer 2: We all experience different levels of trials but we have to be firm in realizing that they are all from Allah.  Recognizing Divine Decree (qadr) is a pillar of faith as is mentioned in the Hadith of Jibreel alayhis salam.  One of the main ways that the Shaytan gets us to question the existence of Allah is to begin by getting us to question Divine Decree.\nHow to Deal With the Divine Decree\nMany people have left faith in God because of not  being able to answer the question, “If there is a God, then why is there evil in the world?” For a Muslim, the answer should be automatic and it is, “Allah does whatever He wills” (Quran 85:16).  I myself repeat this ayah when I see or hear things I cannot understand such as the death of children, atrocities against people, oppression, etc.\nThere is another ayah to repeat and reflect on when we think about things we cannot answer and it is the verse, “He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned” (Quran 21:23). Therefore, do not allow yourself to ask about what has happened unless you first accept it and then you are trying to find wisdom in what happen, as the angels were in asking about the creation of mankind.  Also, when reflecting on what you experienced  think about the prophets and what they experienced\nThey lived lives like we did as a consolation to us.  We cannot fully relate to angels because they do not experience life as we do.  Having prophets as examples allows us to be able to relate to them.  We will all experience aspects of the Seera of the prophets or the Prophet Muhammad (may Allah bless them and our Prophet).\nIf you feel rejected by others, reflect on the people’s rejection of their prophets.  If you feel betrayed, think of Yusef at the bottom of the well (and a person can drown in a well). If you feel alone, think about Musa alayhis salam in the land of Madyan. You should not feel stupid by thinking about your life and experiences.   Your life is a book that Allah gave only to you and He wants you to reflect on your life.  Just as we are to reflect on the heavens and earth, we are to reflect on ourselves as Allah says in the Quran (51:21).\nUsing Life Experience to Strengthen Faith\nYou need to use your life experience to grow stronger in faith and not be weakened.  If you feel weakened by thinking about your life, then you are reflecting on it in the wrong method.  Change the method that you are using to think about your life.  Also remember, that we can sometimes get depressed and reflection and dhikr can help.  Other times the depression becomes clinical and we need medication or therapy. Do not feel embarrassed about seeking out this type of help.  There is no difference between seeking medical help or therapy for physical ailments or mental ailments.\nRami Nsour\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "How to Counteract the Effects of Black Magic",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: Assalamu alaikum. I have a friend who is suffering from major problems at home. Somebody has done black magic on her family . When she goes to sleep she feels something pulling her down and when she woke up in the morning she had deep bruises and scratches on her leg. They experience different things every day. They read Quran on a regular basis but are starting to lose hope in the words of God. I told them to continue reading and not to lose hope.  Is there anything you can recommend to help?\n \nAnswer: What you have advised them is the best thing that you could tell them, which is to keep reading the Book of Allah and to have faith in it.  One thing that I would say is that you could also educate them on the point of who it is reading the Quran.\nDuring the time of Umar ibn Al Khattab (radiya Allahu anhu), he used to recite something in the ears of insane people and they would be freed of the jinn inside them.  One man, who was not insane, wanted to know what Umar was reciting and so he pretended to be insane and then went to Umar.  Umar then recited the Fatiha in his ear.\nThe man then went on to others and began claiming that he could cure the insane.  An insane person came to him and sat for the reading.  When the man recited Fatiha into the ear of the man, he heard the voice of the jinn inside the man saying, “Yes, this is the Fatiha, but where is Umar?”\nSo, although you might have two people reading the Quran, their level of spirituality and connection to Allah and the Quran are different.  The state of the person will also have an effect on whether it works or not. You may advise the family to find someone pious to recite.\nYou should also remind them though, that there are people that are charlatans and can take money from people and claim to be able to help.  They should look to a person with knowledge of the deen (fiqh) and piety (wara) to ask about reading in their house.  They may also ask that person to write them a ruqya (taweez) but it should only be something with Quran, Hadith or the Names of Allah.\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Advising Others and Not Allowing People to Mistreat You",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahu Wa Barakatuhu,\nI work with a non Muslim lady who seems to always have “grudges” against me. Once a week or every few weeks she tends to not talk to me or acts weird towards while she acts normal with the other staff.\nJust last week and today it was obvious she had an issue with me so I politely asked her what was wrong.\nShe replied with that the compliment I made of her hair looking nice and lighter actually offended her. I learned my lesson to not give compliments to non-muslims as it could possibly back fire. I nicely said if I offend you please speak up. I would prefer to speak about it rather than you not speaking to me. After my little speech she said thats okay not to worry, though shes still the same. My boss always praises me, my hard work, and great attitude.\nI would like some advice on how to deal this. I have never been ill mannered or rude towards her, and I want to represent Islam well.\nAnswer:\nAdvise in the Best of Fashions\nIf you are going to advise another person, you should do so in the best of methods (Quran 16:125) and avoid being harsh (Quran 3:159). At times, not saying anything at all will be the advice. For more on enjoining righteousness, see this answer: The Criteria of Enjoining Good and Forbidding Evil  \nStand Up for Your Rights\nAs you said, you do not want people to walk over you, so be sure to stand up to speak the truth. If a person makes an inappropriate comment about Islam, you have a duty to speak up. If you cannot address the issues with the person directly, then go to a manager and report workplace discrimination. If we let too many things go without addressing them, we may be enabling the person who is insulting us and discriminating.\nRelated Answers:\nHow Do I Motivate Someone to Perform the Good?\nA Reader on Calling to Allah, Giving Advice, and Commanding the Good\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Advising Those Who Don’t Handle the Qur’an With Proper Etiquette",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: I personally follow typical etiquette with the Qur’an with regards to reading, placement, etc (i.e. not leaving it on the floor, not having other objects or books of another kind above a placed Qur’an). My brother however tends to leave stuff on my Qur’an and says a little vaguely that some scholars say that the real Qur’an is with Allah, and that a mushaf is simply a mushaf, and no real etiquette of the sort I’m following is necessary. \nI am personally unsure of what action should take precedence; my feeling of leaving nothing on it or his regard and actions of leaving things on it. Secondly, I’m not sure who or how many scholars are of the opinion he has taken. Thirdly, I’m not sure if I can basically say that the majority of scholars say we should treat the Qur’an with proper respect. Fourthly, if the statement aforementioned is in the positive (that is, the majority of scholars do have opinion that regards etiquette with the Qur’an), should I regard the opinion my brother follows as legitimate and possible to follow or not? Jazakallah Khair.\nAnswer:\nThe Word of Allah\nThe statement presented by your brother, “the real Qur’an is with Allah” is not a proof to leave etiquette with the Quran. Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) said, “What is between the covers of the mushaf is the Word of Allah.” We do not believe that the mushaf is God-incarnate in the form of a book, but we do affirm that it is the Word of God.\nExalting the Sacred Books\nIf one was to say that the Mushaf is like anything else, this would be exactly as Qurasyh said when they said, “It is only the speech of a man” (Quran 74:25). The Books of Allah are different than other things in this world and thus we must treat them with respect. We find in a Hadith narrate in the Sunan of Abud Dawud that the Messenger of Allah took a cushion he was sitting on to place upon it the Torah when it was brought to him.\nExalting the Symbols of Allah\nAllah says, “ًWhoever exalts the symbols of Allah, then that is from piety of the hearts” (Quran 22:32). The entire Hajj season is to exalt and commemorate the actions of Ibrahim and Ismael (upon them be peace). Would someone say, “The current Ka’aba is not the exact same bricks that was used by Ibrahim so we do not have a duty to honor it.”\nAdvice\nI would ask your brother if he would be insulted if a person brought a picture of your parents and trampled it with their feet, spat on it and threw it in the garbage. What would his response be if the person said, “I did not do anything to your parents, it was just a picture of them.” I advise us all to read the books on the etiquette with the Quran such as the work Tibyan by Imam Nawawi to learn the proper method of dealing with the mushaf.\nRami Nsour\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "What is the Islamic Understanding of Pride?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: There are narration that speak about the cardinal sin of lowering ones clothing below the ankle out of pride. What is the Islamic understanding of pride – whether in general or in specific to this narration. I am aware (please correct me if I am wrong) that is it disliked to wear clothing below the ankle if not out of pride though if out of pride, the sinful however i do not know what the Islamic understanding of Pride is so can you kindly explain.\nAnswer:\nClothing Below Ankles\nBefore defining pride, what we find in many of the work of the four schools of thought is that it is disliked without a sin (makruh). This is not to deny though that there are many scholars today who hold that it is prohibited to for men to have their clothing below the ankle.\nArrogance (Kibr)\nThe definition of Arrogance (kibr) according to Ibn Juzay is, “A person thinking highly of themselves and looking down upon others.” Imam al-Ghazzali in his Forty Foundations defines pride as, “The reality of arrogance (kibr) is that one deems himself superior to others in regards to qualities of completion which leads to snobbish and overjoyed”.\nThe Causes and Signs of Arrogance\nArrogance can be caused by having knowledge, worship, lineage, courage, strength, beauty, wealth, or prestige. Some of the effects of arrogance is that a person would want a high position in gatherings, being the first while walking, looking down on others, being hateful towards others if they don’t begin with salam, or that when he looks at the masses its like he is looking at donkeys.\nWhat Pride leads to \nArrogance will cause a person to be driven away from the signs of Allah (Quran 7:146). Ibn Zukri said, “As long as a person is arrogant his heart will not submit to truth, accept it, nor benefit from it.”\n(Mawlud, Purification of the Heart)\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "How to Divide the Night in Portions for Worship",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: My question is regarding dividing the night into portions for worship.We find a description of Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam’ s prayer in ahadith and Prophet Dawood Alaihi Salam ‘s prayer. So, when do we start the night, at Maghrib when the new islamic date begins, or at Isha or from the time, we go to sleep. Please guide me as i have always found different answers.\n \nAnswer: The night begins at Maghrib.  In Sura al-Baqara, Allah (the Majestic) says, “And complete the fast until the night” (Quran 2:187).  In the Tafsir of the Jalalayn, it states, “Until the entering of it [the night] when sun sets” [Tafsir al Jalalayn].  The day begins at the true dawn (al fajr al sadiq) as opposed to the false dawn (al fajr al kadhib) [Tafsir al Jalalayn]. Thus, night is from complete sunset until the true dawn and this is what one would use to calculate the various portions of the night such as the first third, the middle of the night, the last third and the last sixth.\nAs an example, if maghrib was at 6 p.m. and fajr was at 6 a.m., then the first third of the night would be 10 p.m., the middle of the night would be 12 midnight, the last third would be 2 a.m. and the last sixth would begin at 4 a.m.\nRami\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Praying for Deceased Muslims Who Were Murderers",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion:  Is it disliked to pray for Muslims who kill?\nAnswer:\nPrayer for a Deceased Muslim\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessing be upon him) taught us to perform the funeral prayer (janazah) for every single person that passed away as a Muslim.  He would only ask whether or not a person was Muslim to perform the prayer, which would include asking forgiveness for the deceased.\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessing be upon him) was also very regular in asking forgiveness for his entire community (umma) as Allah had ordered him to do so [Quran 47:19].  The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) was well aware that would include people who had committed every type of sin.\nThe Vastness of Mercy\nOne teaching that we learn from asking for forgiveness of people who have transgressed is a reminder of the vastness of the Mercy of Allah (the majestic) and how He can forgive any sin except for associating partners with Him [Quran 4:48].  We also learn to ask forgiveness for those who oppress us as the Prophet(peace and blessing be upon him) did during the Battle of Uhud when he was hit in the face and injured.\nWith blood dripping form his face, he said, “O Allah, forgive my people for they know not what they do” [Bukhari].  One of the scholars said that the verse that give us the most hope is, “Say, ‘O my servants who have transgressed against themselves, do not despair of the Mercy of Allah.  Indeed Allah forgives all sins” [Quran 39:53].\nPrayer for an Oppressor Does Not Preclude Justice\nIt is important to note that while we pray for the forgiveness of all Muslims, that does not prevent us from establishing justice.  Although the Prophet (peace and blessing be upon him) made dua for his enemies at Uhud, he continued in the battle against them until he defeated them.  We have compassion for oppressors and criminals, but that does not prevent us from ensuring that justice is fulfilled through the routes of authority and courts.\nAnd Allah knows best\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Transferring Property to Children in One’s Lifetime",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: My parents own a home. They would like to transfer the entire home to me, their only son. However, I am close to my sisters and feel it is best if the home is transferred to all 3 of us.\n \nAccording to Islamic law, what is the distribution or allocation method for this property to all 3 of us (my 2 sisters and myself)? Also why is it not equal distribution, so 1/3rd each?\n \nSo, for example, if the value of the property is £300,000, if £100,000 is not allocated to each of us 3 children, then by what proportion is the allocation made?\n \nAlso, what happens in the event of sale of the property — how are the proceeds supposed to be distributed among the 3 of us?\n \nI also don’t understand if women have equal rights in Islam, why isn’t the allocation fair and equal — why less for women? Is it because they are likely to get married, and therefore take a share of their husband’s property or savings?\n \nAnswer:\nBequests\nTo begin, it is important to understand the difference between a bequest (wasiyah) and a transfer of wealth (hadiya or ‘atiyya).  A bequest is where a person says, “Upon my death, give such and such amount to so and so.” Once the person passes away, there is an assessment to ensure that no debts are owed, that the total bequests do not exceed one third of the deceased person’s total wealth, and then to see if that person is a suitable recipient.\nOne of the matters that would cause a person to not be able to receive a bequest is if they are an inheritor, such as a spouse or child.  The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him said), “There is no bequest to an inheritor” (Tirmidhi).  So, if a person is guaranteed a portion of the inheritance, such as a son or a daughter, they would not be able to receive a bequest. Again, a bequest is the transfer of wealth after the death of a person and it comes from their estate.\nTransfers of wealth\nWhile a person is alive and not on their death bed, technically they are free to give away any portion of their wealth to whoever they would like.  Once a person is on their death bed, they are no longer allowed to give away their wealth since that is akin to giving away the right of the inheritors.  So, if a person’s parents are not on their death bed, they can give their wealth to one child over the other.\nThe Sunna in Giving\nAlthough this is their right, it would be sunna for them to be equal in their distribution of wealth as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “Treat your children equally,treat your children equally, treat your children equally! ” (Ahmed and others).  The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) also said, “Be equal in gifts to your children, and if I were to give more to one I would have chosen the women” (Bayhaqi and Tabarani).\nEqual Rights in Islam\nIn regards to your question about equal rights for women and why they receive a lower share than men, one must understand that there are only certain situations where a woman would get less than a man.  If the deceased left only one son and one daughter, for example, then the son would have two shares of the wealth and the daughter would have one.\nOne of the wisdom in this can be seen when we realize that financial obligations of a family are upon the man and not the woman.  So, the son will take his two shares and support his wife and children whereas the daughters will take her one share and does not have to spend it on her husband and children.  Another thing to realize is that there are situations where a woman would get more than the men, such as in the case where the deceased left a daughter and his brothers (the daughter’s paternal uncles).  The daughter would get one half of the wealth and the brothers, no matter how many would split the remainder.\nYour situation\nYour parents have the right to give you their house without including the daughters.  If it will not anger you parents, you can suggest that they distribute it to you and your sisters. If they do not agree, then what you can do is then give a portion of your wealth to your sisters once the wealth is yours unless your parents had stipulated that you do not give the house to anyone.\nI would suggest that you contact a local scholar to help you work through your situation and do not rely on this reply alone.  There are other opinions in the books of fiqh and your situation is a complex one dealing with inheritance, gifts and rights of parents (birr al walidayn).\nAnd Allah knows best.\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

Nafs, shaytan and Allah.\n \nThank you for any insight.\n \n \nAnswer:\nThe Spring Source of our actions\nAll of our actions spring forth from a thought that enters our heart and this is what makes knowing the science of thoughts (khawatir) so important [Muhammad Mawlud, The Purification of the Heart]. One of the most difficult tasks we face in our lives will be in weighing out each one of the thoughts that enters our heart and seeing which one we should follow. The scholars have given us a guideline as to how to tell the signs of the source of thoughts that enter our heart.\nThe Subtleties of Thoughts\nA person may feel that following a thought may be good, but in reality there is much harm and evil buried deep within that thought.  This is one of the ways the Shaytan  deceives us in a way similar to the story of the Monk Barsisa in Sura 59:16 by wrapping the means to evil in seemingly “good” actions.\nWe must realize the the Shaytan has declared war on us and thus we should not be hasty in action and we must weigh each thought on the scales of the Sharia. The doors that the Shaytan can enter through the heart are many and yet the angels enter through only one and so we must be very careful [Muhammad Mawlud, The Purification of the Heart].\nThe Four Sources of Thoughts\nThere are four sources of thoughts and they are Divine (from Allah), Angelic (from angels), Selfish (from the nafs) and Satanic (from the devil).  Divine and Angelic thoughts are characterized by steadfastness (thabat) while Selfish and Satanic thoughts are characterized by fluctuation/change (taraddud).\nDivine Thoughts\nDivine thoughts come after struggle and worship.  There is a coolness that comes with it and there is not one specific way that it comes.  The thought increases just as dawn does, in that it is slowly steadily and surely.  There is nothing that can stop a Divine thought and the action that is being inspired will definitely be done.  This in contrast to an Angelic thought which can be stopped by a Selfish or Satanic thought.\nAngelic Thoughts\nAngelic thoughts come enjoining only good and will never enjoin evil.  Angelic thoughts will try different avenues to get a person to do good.  For example, they will enjoin prayer and if the person does not do it then they will give them thoughts to do dhikr and then if that is not done a thought to be silent.  There is a coolness that comes with an angelic thought and an expansiveness felt in the heart.\nSelfish Thoughts\nIf a thought of evil enters a person heart but they are not compelled to do it, then it is either a selfish of a satanic thought.  A selfish thought is described to be like the false dawn in that it appears suddenly and is very bright to where one would think that the day has begun.  But just as quickly as it appears, it goes away and only the darkness of night remains.\nSatanic Thoughts\nSatanic thoughts are like a wolf trying to attack a flock of sheep in that if the wolf is turned back from one avenue, he will try another avenue.  The only goal of the devil is to get a person to sin and he doesn’t care what the sin looks like. So, if one thought for a sin doesn’t work, then he tries something else.  Whereas the self only wants to fulfill its desire (shahwa) and thus it will keep coming back to the exact same thing it wants, no matter how many times you turn it away from that.\nIf you get a thought that you are sure there is good in it and you do not fear any harm to come out of it, then it is either a selfish or devilish thought.  This is because some good things can lead to bad such as forbidding evil and it lead to a greater harm.  Both the Selfish and Satanic thoughts can be refuted with remembrance of Allah (dhikr) but dhikr is a medicine that will only benefit one you have built up immunity, which here would be taqwa.\nThe above answer is essentially a direct translation of the section on thoughts from Shaykh Muhammad Mawlud’s book The Purification of the Heart.\nAs for dreams, Allah knows best, but they too can come from the four sources.\nIf you are finding difficulty in doing good actions, this is a good sign as the scholars have said, “One of the signs of acceptance of actions is difficulty found while doing them.”  Keep trying and do not ever give up.  The Shaytan wants us to be in a state of despair and think that we have to give up. There is one scholar in Mauritania who studied the Mukhtasar of Khalil eight times (each time taking about three years) until he felt he finally go it on the ninth time.\nHe was inspired to go for the final time after almost giving up but he saw an ant trying to carry a huge grain up a hill and fell down eight times and made it on the ninth.  He said, “I can’t have less aspiration than an ant.”\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Is My Family a Victim of Witchcraft?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: I am a revert from a Catholic family.  Within the past year and a half my family has gone through a transformation. My brother left his faith and got involved into occult practices, then he recovered, and become a very pious Catholic. However, my mother suspects that my step sister became involved and remains involves in occult practices. \n My mother believes that my step sister is casting spells on my family. She has told me about some of her experiences with my step sister that her religious leaders say is consistent with witchcraft. Recently both my brother and my sister have had some serious unexpected health complications, and my mother believes this might be caused by the practices of my step sister. \nPersonally I have not seen any proof that my step sister is involved in such things. I only rely on the testimony of my mother and some anecdotes that certainly makes one question. My whole family is certain of that she is a witch, however, is it reasonable to believe this under these circumstances? What should I do?\nAnswer: What I would say first and foremost, is that it is reasonable for you to be asking these questions.  As Muslims, we must believe in witchcraft as it is mentioned in the Quran and Hadith.  We also know that one of the worst sins a person can do is witchcraft and that it can have a real affect on people’s health, wealth, marriage, and other other aspects of their lives.\nThere is no scientific way of knowing whether or not your stepsister is in fact practicing witchcraft.  The only way would be a confession or conclusive evidence like you seeing her perform some type of witchcraft.  Just because certain family members are experiencing health issues around the time that your stepsister was involved with witchcraft is not enough evidence to say for sure that she is the cause, but there is still a chance.\nWhat you should do is try your best to help your family keep their bonds of kinship.  When you are around your stepsister, you can be more vigilant about reading Quran or dua to safeguard yourself.  You should also increase your Quran recitation and dhikr at the home where this is possibly happening if you can.  You should be vigilant in reading the last two suras of the Quran (113 and 114) which protect against witchcraft.  You may encourage your step mother to read them and it may be good dawa for her.\nAnd Allah knows best.\nRami\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Is It Authentically Reported that the Prophet Will Marry Maryam and Asiya?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: Is it authentically reported that the Prophet ﷺ will marry Maryam (mother of ‘Isa) and Asiya (wife of Pharaoh)?\nAnswer: The marriage of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) has been narrated through a number of chains.  Some scholars, such as Al Hakim consider it to be sound (sahih).  Other scholars, such as Ibn Katheer, have considered the narrations to be weak (daeef) and say that all narrations on this topic have an issue in one way or another.  Ibn Asakir narrates the Hadith in his famous book Al Tarikh but others, including Ibn Kathir say that the narration used is weak.\n\nOne thing to mention is that although a Hadith may be classified as being weak due to the chain of narrators, weakness does not mean that it is false and untrue. So, even if we were to take the position that the Hadiths are weak, that weakening of the narration does not negate that the reality of what was mentioned possibly being true.\n\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Getting Over Marriage Anxiety When Diagnosed With Hirsutism",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: Assalamualykum,\n \nI am a female assessed with a problem of hirsutism. It has affected my life to the point that I am unable to consider marriage, even though I desire it greatly and keep receiving interests. I disguise the problem using differing techniques and due to my depression have only sufficient energy to struggle with my daily work. I also find socializing to be difficult because of my insecurity issues. Please advise me on how I can proceed and find relief in this situation.\n \n \nAnswer:\nTrust in Allah\nMay Allah make your situation easy. You have to begin by increasing the trust you already have in Allah.  Constantly remind yourself that He is the One who chose this for you and He would never place a burden on a soul more than it could bear.  If it is meant that you find a man to marry, then it will happen, regardless of your anxieties.\nFace your fears\nYou should begin to face your fears and anxiety. A lot of what you are experiencing in terms of thoughts and anxiety is whisperings (waswasa) of the self (nafs) and devil (shaytan). These whisperings will override your logic and cause you to not live your life to its fullest.  The only cure is to ignore these thoughts.\nFind a solution\nOnce you realize that it is possible for you to get married without having to entertain thoughts of being a second wife, then you should go about accessing the means.  This entails pursuing some of the interest that comes your way in terms of requests.  This will also require that at some point you speak with a suitor and let them know about your situation.  Some may accept it some may not.  You have to mentally prepare yourself for this and be content with the possibility of rejection.\nRejection is not a bad thing\nThere are plenty of people in this world that will marry you for who you are and not care about the condition that you have.  This is the kind of person that you are looking for.  As for the ones who would reject you based solely on your condition, they do not deserve to be married to you.  Read and reflect on the many stories of the prophets (upon them be peace) and our Prophet (upon him be the greatest of peace and blessings).  Reflect on how their people rejected them and did not take them for who they were.\nSeek assistance\nYou have built up a lot of pain, emotion, anger, fear, and anxiety throughout your life.  Don’t think that you can unravel these emotions on your own.  You need to reach out to a person experienced in therapy or counseling who can help you work through this.  Once you begin working through your emotions, you will find that approaching marriage will be that much easier.  Ramadan is approaching and you can use this time of inward reflection to your advantage.\nMay Allah alleviate your pain.\nRami Nsour\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Can Souls Return to this World and Communicate With People?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: I have heard from reliable people (family and friends) who claim to see and/or speak with people who have passed away.\n \nI have also read what Quran & Hadith say about the soul and after life which seems that my friend’s stories are contradicting to what i have understood from Quran and Hadith. As per my understanding, there are basically 2 types of souls. Good and Evil. There are levels in the good souls like Prophets, Siddiqeen, Shuhada & Saliheen. I heard stories that pious souls have benefited/helped people in this world. I have also read stories that all souls remain in Barzakh and good souls are enjoying the bounties from Allah (SWT) and evil souls are being punished.\n \n \nCan all souls return to this world and communicate with the people in this world?\n \nAnswer:\nThe Soul is Matter from Allah\nThe first and most important thing to remember when discussing the soul is that we cannot understand the true nature of it.  When some of the Jewish residents of Medina asked the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) about the soul, he recited the revelation, “They ask you about the soul. Say, ‘The soul is a matter of my Lord” [Quran 17:85]\nThe Light of the Sun\nIn the Madhkal of Ibn al Hajj, the author mentions that what has been narrated about the soul is that it resides in the place where it was buried. But to explain the reports of experiences people would have seeing the deceased, he mentioned the likeness of the sun.  Ibn al Hajj showed that in the same way that the sun never moves from its place but we experience its light from far away, so too is the soul in that it could remain in the grave of its owner and yet shine brightly and far away for others to witness, experience and communicate with.\nFor more on this topic please read the following Seekers Guidance answer:\nThe Soul After Death\nFor further reading to learn more about the soul, you may look into the following titles:\nImam al Qurtubi’s Tadhkira or the abridged version of the text entitled Mukhtasar al Tadhkira.\nImam al-Haddad’s The Lives of Man\nImam Ghazali’s Remembrance of Death and the Afterlife\nRami Nsour\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Why Does It Seem That Allah Never Answers My Prayers?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion:Jazak-Allah for your reply to my question from this link: Not Fasting in Ramadan to Study for an Important Exam. I had a follow-up question/s. I wanted to ask in relation to what was mentioned regarding barakah, such as: “as Muslims we believe that we can do less and Allah puts blessings to fill whatever deficiency may outwardly be in our effort.”\nIs there a guarantee that by still fasting Allah will give me the barakah necessary to succeed and do well even with less studying time and effort? Am I supposed to assume Allah will grant it to me without doubt by fasting? Maybe I just have doubt and uncertainty on whether Allah will give me any of the benefits, based on past experiences in my life. I’ve tried to get various benefits promised in the Quran or Hadiths and Allah knows best, I don’t know if I should say for sure, but I think maybe very likely I did not always get those benefits promised in the deen such as:\n1) the healing/curing effect of al-fatiha\n2) Allah accepting and granting my wish when I pray to Allah for the grant of a wish with the dua of Prophet Yunus (as).\n3) I think the hadith is in Abu Dawud that says something like: whoever holds firm to istighfar, Allah will make a way out for them from every tight situation; from every worry & anxiety Allah will give them tranquility, coolness and calmness; and will provide for them from where they know not. Even this I have tried to get and (Allah knows best) I think I did not always get those either.\nThese are just 3 examples, I can probably list more but I’ll leave it at that. I try to have taqwa, I try to do tawba regularly. Shaytan might put thoughts in my head like “why do you still try to get these promised benefits when Allah rejected and ignored you so many times” or “why should you even believe this religion to be truth when you’ve done things to get the promised benefits and they are not even true, they don’t work, these are all just bogus lies”. Please offer some advice or insight into this matter.\nAnswer:\nFear and Prayer\nAllah says, “Whoever has fear (taqwa) of Allah, He will give him a way out” (Quran 65:2) and says, “Call on me I will respond” (Quran 40:60). We believe this to be true and thus if you have fear of Allah and you call on Him, He will give you a way out and will answer your prayers. The thing is, how and when will that be? We are told He will answer us, but we are not told that He will show us how that will occur or when.\nHow a Prayer May be Answered\nYou may be spared many tribulations in your life due to a supplication. Imagine you were on the highway and there was something that could have caused a serious accident but it passed you by without you ever knowing it was headed your way. It was a prayer that you made, or leaving a sin that saved you. If you had been hit, you may have had serious financial problems or health problems. All that passed you by but you didn’t see how your prayer was the answer.\nBe Firm\nStay firm in your practice of the faith and in your supplication. Do not give into the shaytan and despair from what Allah can do for you. If you are experiencing hardship, this is the time that the shaytan will try to make you slip by having you question the Power of Allah and His Justice.\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Not Fasting in Ramadan to Study for an Important Exam",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: I have a really big and important exam to study for and my time is really limited for it. With having to fast, it is more difficult to study and I am maybe not getting as much done as I should because of the difficulty of fasting. Is there any way I can be excused from fasting this month?\nAnswer:\nSeeking a Permissible Income or Career\nAllah has ordered that we struggle to pursue a income that is permissible and at times this means establishing a career or an education that requires examinations. But, the importance of those examinations does not overshadow the importance of the obligations of our faith. Thus, taking an exam or studying for it are not valid excuses to break the fast. The books of law (fiqh) give us extensive lists of what is and what is not considered a valid reason to break a fast.\nWe Are People Who Believe in the Unseen\nRemember that we are people that believe in the unseen and part of that is that we believe in blessing (baraka). This blessing can be in our time or our efforts. So while some people make sure to fulfill every possible outwardly apparent means to gain something, as Muslims we believe that we can do less and Allah puts blessings to fill whatever deficiency may outwardly be in our effort.\nRemember Those Who Came Before Us\nAs an example of blessing, we should remember the noble Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings upon him) who in the month of Ramadan, defeated the polytheists at the battle of Badr. Those noble men were fasting during the summer of Arabia and yet it was their fasting that was one of their reasons for victory.\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Can I Be the Godmother of My Christian Friend’s Daughter?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: I am in a conundrum. I was just asked by a childhood friend to be the godmother of her daughter who will be baptized tomorrow. I wear hijab, so I’m assuming she knows I’m Muslim, but perhaps she doesn’t know what Islam is all about. I am a revert, but I haven’t had much contact with this particular friend since I reverted. So I was surprised by the request and I don’t know how to respond.  I’m honored, and I’d like to be able to say yes, but only if I can do it in a way that doesn’t compromise my beliefs or displease Allah. Please advise!\nAnswer:\nThe Prohibition in Taking Part in Rituals of Other Religions\nThe common understanding of a godparent is that a person be involved to a certain extent in certain rituals associated in bringing children into the church community, such as baptisms. If this is the case, then it is not permissible for a Muslim to take part in the rituals of other religions.\nTaking part in those rituals is prohibited if done without reverence for the rituals. If reverence is held in the heart for those rituals, then that act would constitute apostasy. The reason for this is that we are ordered to only revere the rituals that Allah ordered. Allah almighty has said, “And whoever honors the sacred ordinances of Allah it is best for him in the sight of his Lord” (Quran 22:30).\nTaking Responsibility for the Child\nIf the person is merely asking for you to be a person who can take responsibility for the child throughout her life if the mother was not to be able to take care of her, then this is a permissible and praiseworthy thing. The term that is used for this in Arabic is wakeel which means the person responsible for someone’s matters. Perhaps through your concern for your friend’s child it may be a means for them to see the beauty of Islam.\nWhat to Say to Your Friend\nThus, my advice would be that you gently explain to your friend that your faith does not allow you to take part in the rituals of other faiths but that you would like to be a part of her daughter’s life and that you are overjoyed, honored and elated that she would ask you to do this. If she understands this, then you can be her daughter’s wakeel.\nNo Effect on Marriageability\nOne final note is that this position would not make the child a mahram (non-marriageable relative) and so your husband, brothers and sons would not be able to treat the girl as a mahram when she is older in terms of hugging, shaking hands, being alone with her and so forth. You should pray istikhara before making your final decision.\nRami Nsour\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Marriage to a Non-Practicing Convert and Betraying My Father’s Trust",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: I was born and raised Muslim but was not religious. I met an older non-Muslim man. He converted to Islam to marry me. Then, after being married for a while, I felt that I was missing something significant in my life. I became closer to Allah and started wearing my hijab. I told my husband that I cannot live with him if he is not a practicing Muslim. He was reluctant initially, then he expressed his interest to learn about Islam. He started praying and going to the masjid to learn Quran.\nI still have guilt inside me and need guidance. I feel like I betrayed my father who put a lot of trust in me. He isn’t aware of the above details.  \nAnswer: May Allah reward you for reaching out to ask about the situation that you are dealing with. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessing be upon him, would praise the women of Medina saying that they did not shy away from asking questions about their religion. I personally do not feel as though I understand the reality of your question, but I will try to answer and give advice to the best of my knowledge.\nBeing Muslim is the Most Important Thing\nIf your husband converted to Islam, then that is the most important thing. One’s Islam is the capital of their spiritual investment and actions are like profits to the investment. This does not detract from the importance of practice of the faith, but it is to show the grand nature of faith alone.\nOnce, Abdullah the son of Umar (may Allah be pleased with them), looked at the Kaaba. He said, “How wonderful you are and how wonderful you are in the sight of Allah, and the status of one believer is grander than you.” So, sister, if your husband professed the faith of Islam, he is more precious and valuable than the Ka’bah. Keep this in mind.\nContinue to Encourage Him to Improve\nYou have taken a great step in encouraging him to improve on the practice of his faith. You should continue in this firm resolve and help him improve while you yourself also improve. The only thing to remember, is that while you and he work on the practice of Islam, you have to pace yourselves.\nThe Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, instructed us to take the practice of this faith while pacing ourselves so as not to burn ourselves out. At the same time, you have to realize that you may “run” faster spiritually than your husband. So, two things to remember are; 1) is that don’t allow your speed to be slowed down by him and 2) Be patient with the runners who cannot run as fast as you.\nConsult the People of Knowledge\nThe way to pace yourself is to keep in constant contact with the scholars and ask them advice at every point of this journey you are on. As Muslims we cannot be guided through our personal opinions or feelings, rather we have to ask when we do not know. Allah has said, “Ask the people of knowledge if you do not know.” Feel free to reach out to us here at the Answer service for Seekers Hub Global to guide you along your journey.\nYour Duty to Your Father\nAs for your relationship with your father, I would not be able to advise anything since I do not know the details of what transpired between you to make you feel like you betrayed your father. What I can say is that as long as you were following the tenets of the religion, you have completed your duty. If there were matters your father wanted of you and they were above and beyond the obligations of the religion, and beyond your capability, you will not be held responsible for them.\nWe offer a course on the Rights of Parents that you may consider taking so that you can gain more insight onto the true nature of what you obligated to do for your parents.

      "Question": "Giving Charity to Non-Muslims When There Are Many Poor Muslims",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: Is it ok to be generous towards non-Muslims?\nI believe it is preferred to favor the Muslims first, but in our daily life in a majority non-Muslim country, we frequently encounter needy non-Muslim individuals and organizations and it always struck me how our Prophet peace be upon him has been sent as a mercy to the worlds. However, if I give some money to them, then I’ll be giving none or less to mosques,poor Muslims etc.\nPlus, these hadith also questions our priorities\n1.“Do not keep company except with a true believer, and let not anyone eat your food except one who is godfearing.” [Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud]\n2. Pardon me for not having a proper quote but the other hadith I came across is along the lines of : among the losers are those who give benefit to those who do not benefit them.\nIf this is so, should our wealth and efforts only be reserved for our fellow Muslims since there is always a deserving Muslim somewhere?\nJazakallahu khayr\nAnswer: The Messenger of Allah said, “In every moist liver there is a reward.” This means that in giving something to every living creature there is a reward. This includes giving seeds to birds and crumbs to fish or ants.\nSo while we can give our charity in so many different areas, we have to prioritize. Shaykh Muhammad Mawlud, in his text on the Adab of Charity, explains that the best type of charity to give is water. He also explains that the best place to give is to a scholar who is worshiping Allah.\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that just as the people of business try to “diversify their portfolio” in investments, we too have to do that in charity. We never know which charity Allah will accept from us.\nWe have to keep in mind to that one thing that will place a cause high on our list of priorities is need (darurah). So, if there is a catastrophe in an area, our charity should go there before other places.\nAnother thing that will affect where we place our charity, is looking at those directly near us. This will include our families , friends and close community members.\nSo, as advice to the dilemma that you face, you should give to both Muslims and non-Muslims. But how you prioritize will differ throughout your life.\nAnd Allah knows best.\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

Recently I failed one unit due to not studying something that was forced on me.   I have suffered a lot due to stress. The University acknowledged my situation and has allowed me to carry on and pick a suitable subject.\nHowever i have doubts whether I should carry on. I am the only member of my family that has had problems with education. Ever since the age of 16 strangers, friends, and family have told me I am slow and stupid.\nMy self esteem is very low and I doubt I can do well at University after listening to what others say.  I feel sad and lonely at times. I want to study and do well so I can work for the ummah.  I regularly send blessings on the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) at night to help with feelings of sorrow and loneliness.\nAnswer: May Allah make things easy for you my dear brother. The situation that you are dealing with is not an easy one. When insults come from those who are closest to us they can hurt and damage us the most.\nRights of Parents\nMy advice to you first and foremost is to remain humbly respectful to your parents no matters what they say to you. Ibrahim alayhis salam had a father who told him that he would stone him. Yet in response, Ibrahim alayhis salam spoke very respectfully to him. You should consider taking our course on the Rights of Parents to help you guide your way through dealing with your parents.\nDeen vs. Dunya\nAnother thing that you should be sure to train yourself to think about, is the difference between the knowledge and work of the deen (religion) and that of the dunya (worldy affairs). As long as you do not fall short in your religious affairs, then others do not have a right to blame you. The only exception is dunya that serves the deen, like working to support ones self and their family.\nUniversity Studies\nIn terms of carrying on with your university education, why would you stop it? As long as it does not take you away from studying the knowledge of this deen, then you should keep going with it. It will give you a standing to support yourself throughout your life and make learning and practicing the deen easier.\nInsults\nIn terms of people insulting you in various ways, you do not have to stand for it. You should politely tell your parents that those words harm you. For others who hurl the insults, you can be more assertive in letting them know they have hurt you. You should also remove yourself from the place where you are being insulted.\nThis is a type of hijrah (immigration), even if it means just going to to another room. Do not sit there and take it. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings upon him, taught us to not allow ourselves to be belittled. So you must do whatever you can to protect your honor.\nDealing with the Pain\nYou have found a wonderful way of dealing with the pain that you are experiencing Sending prayers on the Prophet sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam is a healing for the hearts. I would also encourage you to increase your reading of the Quran as well. Reading Sura Yusuf has been found to help heal sadness.\nAbu Dom Dom\nYou should also implement the practice of Abu Dom Dom. He was a man in Jahiliyya (Days of Pre-Islamic Ignorance) who used to say every morning, “O Allah, I give my honor as a charity to the people.” He would intend that everything that he was owed, in terms of people slighting his honor, he would give away as charity. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings upon him, said, “Are any of you incapable of being like Abu Dom Dom?” This practice of “giving up” things is a time-tested healing.\nAs long as we hang on to the hurt that others have caused us, it will continue to hurt us. Even physiologically every time we think about the hurt our body releases cortisol and other hormones that cause stress similar to when we first experienced the pain the first time. Thereby leading to a perpetual hurt. The practice of Abu Dom Dom, approved and encouraged by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) can break this vicious cycle.\nPlease keep in contact with us here at Seekers and take our courses. There is healing and guidance in seeking knowledge.\nYour brother,\nRami Nsour\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Is It Permissible for Women to Wear Heels?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shahkh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: Salaam Alaykum,\nCould you please tell us if it is permissible for women to wear heels? I have read that since they make a noise when we walk, it attracts the attention of men which makes it impermissible. However, what if they do not make a noise when one walks. What is the ruling on it?\nAnswer: If the heels make noise and attract the attention of men when a woman walks, then it would not be permissible (haram). This is because Allah says, “And let them not stomp their feet to make known their adornment which has been concealed” [Quran 24:31]. This was in reference to ladies who would wear bangles and stomp to make a sound thereby attracting the attention of men.\nIf they do not make noise, there remains another issue. High heels are worn for attraction, and can accentuate the female body and movements. A recent study on high heels showed that both men and women find that high heels make a woman more attractive. See the following Huffington Post article:\nWhy Do High Heels Make Women More Attractive? \nThe style of dress and walk that a Muslim woman should adopt should be something that avoids attracting attention as much as possible. Sisters should try to emulate the model of the daughter of Shuayb (peace be upon him) who would later marry Musa (peace be upon him). About her, Allah said, “She came walking with modesty” [Quran 28:25].\nAnother wisdom that we find in women, and men for that matter, reducing the attention of others, is to prevent jealousy and evil eye. The more we stand out to others, the more that we put ourselves in a position to have them possibly feel jealous of us.\nIn conclusion, it is prohibited for a woman to wear high heels if they accentuate her form to others or if they cause a sound that would attract the attention of men. And Allah knows best.\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Takbirs During the Days of Eid al-Adha in the Maliki School",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: In the Maliki school, what is the legal ruling of reciting the takbirs? When do we begin reciting the takbirs and when does it end.  Also, how many times is it recited after each prayer? \nAnswer: The takbirs (saying “Allahu Akbar”) after the obligatory prayers done during the days of Eid al Adha are considered a recommended act (mandub) according to the Maliki school of thought.\nThe takbirs would be done after 15 obligatory prayers beginning with the dhuhr after the Eid al Adha prayer and ending with the subh (dawn) prayer of the fourth day of Nahr. The fourth day of Nahr is essentially the fourth day of Eid.\nThe way the takbirs should be stated is “Allahu akbar” three times after each of the 15 fard prayers. This formula is related in a Hadith. This is the narration that is found in the Mudawwana. There is another formula that is mentioned in the Mukhtasar of Ibn Abdul Hakam which is; Allahu akbar (twice), la illaha illa Allah (once), Allahu akbar (twice), wa lillahi hamd (once).\nBoth narrations are strong and can be followed. The narration of the Mudawwana is stronger. It would be disliked to add anything other than what has been narrated for the takbir formula.\n[Hashiyatul Dasuqi ala Sharh al Kabir]\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

I’ve heard that it is permissible in the Shafi’i school.\nAnswer: According to the Maliki madhab, it is permissible to perform unbroken fasting. There is no dislike in fasting continuously and it would actually be recommended if a person is able to do it.\nIn response to the Hadith forbidding continuous fasting, the Maliki scholars have responded with the proof that there is consensus (ijma’) that if a person promised to fast continuously, he would have to fulfill it.

      "Question": "Advice on Breaking an Unwanted Marriage Engagement",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Saira AbuBakr\nQuestion: assalamu alaikum!\nI have a friend who got engaged some years ago. He never wanted to get engaged to that person but never directly said ‘no’. He tried to refuse by making other excuses like ‘ not now, etc’ but he agreed due to feeling pressured.   Afterwards he tried to show that he wasn’t happy and now he is directly saying that he doesn’t want to marry this girl. The parents got upset and said this decision will break many relations because the engagement is done. They say the girl is better than someone he would choose for himself and they only want the best for him. \nHow should this person and his parents be advised?\nAnswer: walaikum salaam wa RahmatuAllah ,\nMay Allah make the situation easy. It would be recommended to ask your friend if he has any religious reasons for disliking her. Also are they compatible in-terms of their upbringing, education, social and financial class?\nWe have a great example in the Seerah of our beloved Messenger, peace and prayers upon him, of a marriage between two very righteous, but incompatible companions:\nOut of obedience to the Messenger of Allah (peace and prayers upon him), Sayyidah Zaynab bint Jah-sh (the cousin of the Messenger of Allah), married Sayyidna Zayd (initially adopted by the Prophet). However Sayyidah Zaynab was from an aristocratic, arab clan (Bani Hashim) and Sayydina Zayd, a freed, African slave. As a consequence, Sayyidah Zaynab was very unhappy in the marriage and it was eventually dissolved with the revelation of ayahs that married the Messenger of Allah to his cousin and abolished adoption.\nIf it is not any of the above then the brother should assess if their temperaments are incompatible. That alone can cause tension between people.\nHowever, if he has no Islamic reason for refusing his parents wishes, I would advise him to do istikharah about whether she will be a means of him getting closer to Allah. He should repeat the istikharah until he has clarity in the matter. He may also, if he so wishes, ask another (someone with an objective view) to perform istikharah on his behalf.\nIf the istikharah indicates that she will be help him grow in his religion and his parents are still insisting, then he should ask Allah to place compassion and mercy in his heart for this sister. This is the basis of a good marriage and he should know that Allah is able to turn a person’s heart towards anyone He wishes.\nSuratul Baqarah; ayah 216:\nYet it may happen that you hate a thing and it is good for you; and it may happen that you love a thing and it is bad for you. (Taken from AlTafseer.com; Translation: Feras Hamza)\nIf the istikharah or a glaring trait in her character indicates that she is not suitable for him, then he should communicate this to his parents.\nOne would advise him to communicate properly with his parents, all the while maintaining the utmost adab. Arguments will remove blessing from the discussion. Often times mothers may be won over by speaking about ones feelings and how sad one would be if married to this person. It should not turn into an argument of who is right or wrong nor be laden with guilt-trips.\nAlso, advise him to try to communicate to his parents that he wants to treat his wife with love and respect. If he is married to someone whom he dislikes, it might be very difficult to treat her with excellence, as is the sunnah. A woman can sense if her husband dislikes her and if she is unhappy as she knows her husband doe not love her, her parents are sure to find out. This may eventually lead to bigger problems between families. A divorce or constant bickering between husband and wife will not strengthen the relationship between the families either.\nMost parents ultimately do want their children to be happy but are sometimes entrenched in obsolete cultural practices/modes of thinking not based in the religion. Above all, he should make dua that his parents are pleased with him.\nIf it reaches an impasse, he should reflect on his life and remove anything that would be displeasing to Allah and His Messenger, peace and prayers upon him. In doing this one should begin with the impermissible. Scholars of sacred knowledge say that difficulties come for two reasons. Firstly, as an expiation for the wrong one is doing in one’s life and secondly to raise one in rank. In the end, if one has the proper intention, it can all be a means of getting closer to Allah.\nFinally, if the brother has not fulfilled his religious obligations by taking the classes he needs, he should try to start this right away. If he does not know where to start then he needs to consult a scholar. He may email Seekers Guidance for direction in this regard.\nSaira AbuBakr\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Can We Ever Be Excessive in Following the Sunna (Maliki)?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: Is it possible to say: “If you do an excessive act which is Sunna it is haram and punishable”?\nAnswer:\nExcessiveness\nTo do something excessively is called “ghuluw” in Arabic. Excessiveness can range from being disliked (makruh) to being prohibited (haram). A person will have to check the ruling case by case to know whether excessiveness in a particular matter is disliked or prohibited.\nWudu\nAn example of excessiveness would be like a washing the limbs in wudu. The method according to the sunna is to wash three times. If a person adds a fourth or a fifth washing, then this is considered excessiveness according to the Maliki scholars. There are some who said it is disliked and others who said it would be a prohibited form of excessiveness. [See the section of Wudu from the Mukhtasar of Khalil]\nDisliked Excessiveness\nExamples where excessiveness would be disliked are; paying more than what is owed in zakat, doing more than the specific number of dhikr mentioned in Hadiths (like the 33 statements after prayer).\nThe Sunna of the Sunna\nIf a person is following a sunna in the proper method it was passed down, they will avoid excessiveness. This is why it is important to not only know the sunna, but how to perform the sunna. There is a sunna of performing the sunna.\nAn example would be eating dates to break one’s fast, which is sunna. The method to eat the dates would be that there be an odd number of dates, one at a time, taken with the right hand, begin chewing on the right side of the mouth (for the first bite) and to not make sounds while eating.\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

But I can’t imagine wearing a niqab.\nAnswer: A woman who is from the descendants of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) does not have a specific duty of niqab. Wearing niqab would follow the same difference of opinion that applies to Muslim women in general. There is a valid difference of opinion on whether or not a woman must wear niqab. [See the commentaries of the Mukhtsar on the Section of Covering in Prayer]\nThe only ruling legal ruling (fiqh) specific to the Family of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) is that they cannot accept zakat. But even this is lifted when they are in need and do not find an income from the Muslim Treasury (Baytul Maal).

      "Question": "Is It Sinful to Eat With the Left Hand? (Maliki)",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Saira AbuBakr\nQuestion: Assalamu alaikum. If someone is left-handed and eats with the left hand is it a sin?\nAnswer: May Allah reward you for your question.\nIn the Maliki school it is not considered sinful to eat with the left hand. However it is a sunnah of the Messenger of Allah, peace and prayers upon him, to eat and drink with the right hand. This is true for both left and right-handed people. Leaving a sunnah is discouraged (makruh).\nThere is no harm in writing with the left-hand. Traditionally scholars would not discourage children from writing with the left hand.\nIn general, actions that are considered significant in the religion should be carried out with the right hand. This is especially true if these actions have been mentioned in prophetic narrations (narrations) as praiseworthy.\nIn the Risalah of Imam Ibn Abi Zayd al Qayrawani the author mentions the following:\nIf you (intend to) eat and drink then it is required (a confirmed sunnah) to say Bismillah and to take (what you will be eating or drinking) with the right hand (also a confirmed sunnah). When you have finished (eating or drinking) then say, ” Alhamdulillah” (silently). It is recommended to lick the fingers (but not by putting them all the way into the mouth) before you wipe your hands.\nOne of the etiquettes of eating is leaving one-third of your stomach for food, one-third for drink and one-third for breathing (i.e. empty). If you eat with another person (from the same plate) then take from what is immediately in front of you and do not take another morsel until you are done with the previous one. Don’t breathe in the glass (vessel) when you drink. (Taken from: Chapter on the Etiquettes of Eating and Drinking).\nIt is important to note:\nA confirmed sunnah is an act the Messenger of Allah, peace and prayers be upon him, would do on a consistent basis and rarely leave. There is great reward associated with a sunnah act. It is discouraged to leave it (but not sinful). That is the basic ruling.\nHowever, one of the greatest ways to get close to the Messenger of Allah, peace and prayers upon him, is to follow his practices.\nThe Messenger of Allah is reported to have said: “A person is with the one he loves.”\nSaira AbuBakr\nChecked & Approved by Shaykh Rami Nsour\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

Are there specific criteria that need to be met concerning the *need* of this type of dog besides one’s own subjective interpretation of needing a watch dog?\nAnswer: If there is a reasonable cause to own a watchdog, then it would be permissible to own one. If there is a reasonable need to have that dog inside the house, then it would be permissible to keep the dog in the house.\nWhat is ‘reasonable’ would be defined by the people of a certain area and the experts in that field. So, a person should ask the opinion of local enforcement as well as pious Muslims in that area to determine what is reasonable.\nThe criteria for owning a dog would be that one feeds it food that is not impure (najasa). Therefore, one would have to buy vegetarian food or use meat that is from a properly slaughtered source.\nAnother reason for not purchasing conventional dog food would be that Muslims should not support the modern, mass meat processing industry that is inhumane. The torture of animals is prohibited, and the modern meat industry has extreme torture in the raising and processing of animals for meat.\nAnother criteria for owning a dog is to make sure that the impurities of the dog, do not affect the clothing and area of prayer.

The entire rak’a does not necessarily need to be replaced by missing an obligatory action.\nMissing Ruku’\nIf a person forgot to perform the ruku’ and went straight into prostration (sajdah), he or she would rise back up to the ruku position and pick up from there. The person would not go to a standing position and then make ruku, but rather go from prostration to a ruku position, then rise and then go to prostration. The person would then continue the prayer and prostrate twice after the final salam (ba’dy).\nRemembering Missing a Ruku from a Previous Raka\nIf a person is in a rak’a and remembered missing an obligation from a previous rak’a that cannot be addressed, they would consider the entire rak’a with the missed portion to be canceled out. If the missed portion was the first rak’a, then the second would become the first and the third would become the second. The person would then continue and then prostrate for the forgetfulness.\nIf the missed rak’a was from the first two, then a pre-salam prostration (qabli) would be done, if it was remembered after completing the third rak’a. If the missed rak’a was from the last two, or the first two but remembered before completing the third, then a post-salam prostration (ba’dy) would be done.\nStudy Al-Akhdari\nAs one can see, the rules of forgetfulness are very detailed and requires one to study.

      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Ustadh Tariq Abdul-Rasheed\nQuestion: If a person travels regularly for halal reasons, but repeatedly engages in acts that are haram during his travels, is he permitted to a) cut his prayers short?, and b) do tayammum?\nAnswer: In the name of Allah the Beneficent the Merciful\nTravelling for Permissible or Impermissible Reasons\nThe scholars of the Maliki school differentiate between a person travelling for the clear intention of committing sin and a person travelling for the intention of something permissible, encouraged or obligatory. The former would be like one travelling to Las Vegas in order to gamble. The latter would be like one travelling to Las Vegas to visit family and during the visit engages in gambling.\nIf travelling to engage in sinful acts then shortening the prayer is impermissible. If travelling for permissible reasons but thereafter falling into sin then it is permissible to shorten the prayer.\nTayammum for the Traveler\nTayammum is only valid for the traveler due to particular causes. Namely;\nInability to find water. Meaning:\n1. Inability to find any water at all.\n2. Water is available but not a sufficient amount to wash the limbs which are obligatory to wash in wudu (or ghusl as may be the case).\nInability to use water. Meaning:\n1. Due to illness where there is a legitimate fear that using water will increase ones illness or delay recovery.\n2. A legitimate fear that one will become ill by using water (as in the case of extreme cold).\n3. Inability to get water due to fear of being attack (such as in remote areas with wild animals).\n4. Fear of wealth being destroyed by getting or purchasing water (such as being stolen or attacked and stolen by force).\n5. Legitimate fear that the prayer time will exit by the time water it found.\nIf one does not meet these condition then it would not be permissible to make tayammum while travelling. Since water it generally available and not difficult to store for later use. One should be cautious to prepare and have water available when needed.\nRepentance is an Obligation\nWe ask Allah (Most High) to protect from every sinful act and foul habit. We are reminded that repentance is obligatory for every sin and that is it not permissible to delay it. Be mindful as the unintentional sin that becomes repetitive my leave a sweetness in the heart (Allah forbid). So the unintentional sins of today may become the intentional sins of tomorrow.\nPlease see A Reader on Tawba (Repentance)\nAnd Allah knows best\nTariq Abdul-Rasheed\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "On Arriving Late to Audible Congregational Prayer (Maliki)",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: Is my prayer sound if I missed the first two rakats of Isha prayer with the Imam, then recited them quietly when I got up to finish my prayer?\nAnswer: If one stands up to make up the first two units (rak’as) of an audible prayer, then they would have to recite loud enough to where the person standing next to them can hear them.\nIf a person is in an area where others are praying, then one should only recite loud enough to hear themselves. This is so as not to disturb others who are praying.\nIf a person does not recite audibly unintentionally when they should have, then they prostrate after the prayer (ba’dy) twice. If they left audible recitation intentionally or due to ignorance of the ruling, then nothing is owed and the prayer is sound.\nFor ladies, regardless of the situation, they are to recite audible prayers only to where they can hear themselves.\n[Mukhtasar Khalil]\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion:Before going into prayer does it make sense to have prayer clothes even though this sounds like Christian – “Sunday’s Best”?\nAnswer: It is recommended to wear one’s best clothes when praying alone, in congregation or on the Friday prayer. This recommendation can be achieved without setting aside a specific outfit for that prayer. But, if a person were to say set aside specific clothes for the Friday prayer, this would be a noble thing.\nIt is mentioned in the Rules of Burial (janaza) that if a person had a specific outfit for Friday prayers, that they should be buried in that, rather than just the simple shrouds of burial (kafan). This is because those are the clothes that the person would have done so much worship in and that would benefit them in the grave.

      "Question": "Giving an Adopted Child Your Family Name",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: I’ve read “The Fiqh of Adoption” on your website. I have questions regarding the legal issues that arise when we want to care for an orphan, particularly an abandoned baby. Please shed some light on this important issue that is the cause of many people not helping when they are able.\nIn some Muslim countries, there are thousands of babies abandoned each year who are sent to orphanages. Since there are so many that are not being cared by people within that country, is it permissible to “adopt” those children and bring them to one’s own country?\nIn the US, a new birth certificate is issued with the adoptive parents’ names on it. Is this a hindrance if the child is raised to know the adoptive parents are not his blood parents?\nWhat do we do about naming a child when the father’s name (and mother’s name) are unknown as in the case of babies found on the streets? Can the child in this circumstance be given the adoptive father’s family name or should it be given some other sort of name?\nAnswer:\nThe Obligation of Caring for Orphans\nIn terms of caring for orphans or abandoned children, this is an obligation upon the Muslim community and a very noble act. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessing be upon him) said, “I and the caretaker of the orphan will be in Paradise like these [two fingers]” then he held up his index finger and middle finger together [Bukhari]. If you are planning on caring for an orphan or an abandoned child, I ask that Allah ennoble you in this life and the next and that He give me the ability to follow in your footsteps.\nWhat is Prohibited When Adopting?\nIn terms of adoption, the thing that is prohibited is changing the lineage of the child. This would be where the child refers to the adoptive parent as their father or mother, and does not claim the true parent to be their parent [Maharim al Lisaan, Muhammad Mawlud].\nIf a person needs to file legal paperwork to be given the guardianship of a child or to process visa work, there may be a requirement to give the child the family’s name. This is permissible as long as the child is raised to know his or her lineage and that the legal last name is merely for registration purposes.\nHistorical Examples of Taking on Another Family Name\nOne thing to point out is that in many societies, entire tribes would take on the names of other tribes for various reasons. Many times, this would be for protection. By taking the last name of another tribe that was more powerful, it would give protection to tribes with less power.\nAs an example, many of the Idirisi Shurafa in Morocco would not go by their family name of Idrissi hundreds of years ago. They were living at a time when the Idrisi family was being persecuted by the ruling government. So you find some Idrisi families today that hold the last name of other families, but they usually know that they are Idrisi.\nThis has at times led to people losing track of their lineage though by the obscurity that it causes. For this reason, extra care should be taken when another family name will be used by the “adopted” child. The caring family should help create a written document or family tree for the child. They may also encourage the child to legally change the last name back to the original name once they are 18 or 21.\nAnd Allah knows best.\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Friday Prayer When Traveling in the Maliki School",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: Assalaam alaykum,\nI will be traveling on a Friday for a work conference. I will be leaving for the conference right after Fajr salah and will be coming back home from the conference the same day, around the time that Dhuhr comes in.\nI wanted to know if I should go attend Jumah in the city I will be in at the time or if I should pray Dhuhr and then be on my way home.\nThank you.\nAnswer: If I understand it correctly, you will be outside your city of residence at time of Dhuhr on Friday. If that is the case, then you have the choice to pray Jumu’ah in the city of the conference or you could pray dhuhr there. You could also pray dhuhr when you return home.\nIf you return to your city limits in time for Jumua’h, then you are obligated to pray Jumu’ah. If you miss the Jumu’ah prayer, then you would pray Dhuhr.\nGeneral Rules About Traveling on Friday\nIf a person lives in a city where there is a valid Jumu’ah prayer, then it would be prohibited to travel after dhuhr time comes in, if the destination does not have a Jumu’ah prayer. If a person leaves their city after dawn but before dhuhr time, to an area with no Friday prayer, then this would be disliked. If the person traveled after fajr, but before dhuhr, it would not be obligatory to find a Friday prayer in the destination.\n[Al-Sharh al Kabir, Mukhtasar Khalil]\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "The Traveler’s Prayer, Mixing Madhabs, and Maliki Reference Works",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: Assalamu ‘aleikum. I have a few Maliki fiqh questions.\n1. I currently live in one city and study in another city that is 163 km away from my city of residence. I travel there by train and it takes approximately 1 hour and 10 minutes. Can I consider myself a traveler while being in the city where I study and may I join prayers if there is a practical need to do so?\n2. Is it obligatory or recommended for the traveler to shorten the prayers?\n3.  Is it generally permissible to follow the opinion of another madhab when there are real difficulties involved in not doing so? \n4. Every madhab has some book which is considered a reference work, a book to turn to for reference when it comes to detailed or complicated issues. For the Shafi’is I think Imam al-Nawawis al-Majmu’ would be considered one such work, and for the Hanbalis al-Mughni of Ibn Qudama. Would Al-Kharshis explanation of Mukhtasar Khalil be considered such a work in the Maliki madhab, which has been printed with a hashiya of shaykh al-’Adawi, or is al-Sharh al-kabir with the hashiya of al-Dasuqi a stronger reference?\nAnswer:\n1. The distance that you mentioned is sufficient to be considered a traveller and shorten your prayers. For the Maliki ruling on joining prayers, it would only be while you are en route during your journey. In the situation where you described about studying, you could pray maghrib and isha when you return to your home. While you are on campus, since you are a traveller, you can also join dhuhr and asr. It would be preferred for you to dealy Dhuhr to pray with Asr.\n2. The shortening of prayers is a strong sunna according to the Maliki school.\n3. Following the opinion of another school of the four schools of thought is valid and permissible, as long as one does the whole act of worship (or interaction) according to that opinion. If for example, one will follow a Shafi’i opinion on wudu, they should also make their prayer valid according to the Shafi’i school. To join between multiple opinions is called talfeeq and is not permissible.\nWhen choosing to follow the opinion of another school there must be a need. This is called a dispensation (rukhsa) and is permissible. What is not permissible is constant following of dispensations (it-tiba’ al rukhas). This has been mentioned by the scholars such as Imam Nawawi in the Maqasid.\n4. The two commentaries on the Mukhtasar that you mentioned are relied upon works and may be referenced when needed. In general, the Mukhtasar and its commentaries are difficult to navigate unless one has studied them with a teacher.\nI would also suggest that you begin reading and referring to a more basic work, such as Ibn Ashir or Risala. Both have translations in English available on the internet.\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "The Language of the Friday Sermon (Khutba) in the Maliki School",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: As salamu ‘alaykum. It is valid in the Maliki school for the person giving the Friday khutba to translate passages from the Arabic khutba in the local language for the assembly, or is it forbidden to have any word in other language than Arabic in the khutba?\nAnswer:\nArabic in the Khutba\nAccording to the Maliki school, the Khutba must be in Arabic for it to be valid. If one were to speak English for a short portion of the Khutba, it would not invalidate the Khutba. This is with the condition that the speech in a non-Arabic language was not very long.\nWhen one speaks a non-Arabic language in the prayer, it is as if they are silent. This is based on the principle of “that which is not recognized by the Shariah is treated as if it does not exist” (al ma’dumu shar’an kal ma’dumi hissan) A pause in the Khutba is permissible if it is not long. So when someone speaks a non-Arabic language, it does not count and therefore is given the ruling of silence. This same rule applies to the Khutba of Eid.\nAlternatives\nIf a person is in a non-Arabic speaking country, they can have a short lesson in language other than Arabic and then give an all-Arabic Khutba. The scholars mention that even if a people do not understand Arabic, the Khutba portion should still be in Arabic. They say that there is a secret in that Arabic language in that it can reach the hearts of those who cannot understand it.\nThe Wisdom of Arabic\nShaykh Muhammad Illish, in his footnotes on the marginal notes of Dusuqi on the Sharh al Kabir on Khalil mentions this. He says about the Khutba being in Arabic, “Even if the congregation are non-Arabic speakers, because the words of truth will reach and affect the heart, even if their meaning is not understood. This is the same as the recitation of the Quran.”\nHe then goes on to say, “The person giving the Khutba must understand the words, and so it is not sufficient for a non-Arabic speaker to merely say the words if he does not understand them.”\nAdvice\nThe platform of the Friday prayer is a crucial part of maintaining Islam among the community members. For a those living in a non-Arabic speaking land, all care should be taken in not cancelling or avoiding the Friday prayer. If the Maliki ruling cannot be maintained following the above guidelines (including having Arabic and interspersed English) then a community should seriously consider following the valid opinion of another school that allows a non-Arabic khutba. I have discussed a similar situation in the following answer:\nIs Friday Prayer Valid in a Rented Space in the Maliki School?\nAnd Allah knows best.\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Inhaling Smoke, Emitting Pre-Sexual Fluid, Accidental Eating and Fasting in Maliki School",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: Is it true that in the Maliki school if you unintentionally inhale cigarette smoke, steam or incense, emit pre-ejaculatory liquid or accidentally eat food that you’ve broken your fast?\nAnswer:\nInhaling Smoke, Steam and Incense While Fasting\nAccording to the Maliki school, inhaling smoke, steam or incense:\n1. Will break the fast if the smoke reached the back of the throat. This is if the smoke was inhaled intentionally, or care was not taken to avoid it.\n2. Will not break the fast if the inhalation was beyond one’s control. An example would be when one is on a street and inhales some accidentally.\nThe reason for this ruling given by Al-Dusuqi in his marginal notes on the Sharh Al-Kabir by Dardir on the Mukhtasar is that, “incense and steam are both matter and have an affect on the brain, giving it a benefit similar to that of food.”\nPre-ejaculatory Fluid (madhy)\nIn terms of the pre-ejaculatory fluid (madhy):\n1. It breaks the fast if a person had control over the thoughts or touching, and then the fluid was released.\n2. If one did not have control over the release of madhy, such as when one is asleep, then the fast is not broken.\nWhile fasting, one of the matters that we must control is the intentional release of sexual fluid in addition to avoiding consumption of food and drink.\n[Mukhtasar Khalil]\nAccidentally Eating or Drinking\nIf one accidentally eats or drinks somethings, the fast is broken but they must continue the fast until sunset. The process of continuing to fast after it has been broken is called “imsaak.” The person who eats or drinks accidentally would then have to repeat that fast.\nThe reason why Imam Malik considered the fast to not be valid is that the purpose of fasting, which is not having anything digestible reach the throat or stomach, was not completely achieved.

      "Question": "Using Soapy Water for Ghusl in Maliki School",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: Is it permissible to use soap to make ghusl in the Maliki school considering its strictness on rubbing the whole body with the hand?\n \nAnswer:  You must not use soap during a ghusl in place of the obligation of rubbing the body.  In the Maliki madhab, one of the conditions of wudu and ghusl is rubbing (dalk) which is defined as “passing one limb over the other” but it does not have to be with the hand alone [Dusuqi, Hashiya al Sharh al Kabir].  You can technically use your forearm to rub your other arm, for example.  You can also use a rope or the like in the case of areas that are hard to reach [Ibnr Ashir, al-Murshid al-Muin].\nThe issue with soap is that it changes the water and one must use water in its natural form (mutlaq). If the water reaches the body in a pure form but changes after it has made contact with the skin, like if there is soap on the body, then that is excused [Dusuqi, Hashiya al-Sharh al-Kabir]. The best thing is to avoid soap during a ghusl to ensure that all water reaches the body in a pure form (mutlaq).  If one wants to use soap before or after the ghusl to remove filth, then there is no harm in that.\nAnd Allah knows best.\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "What is the Limit of Using Honorific Titles for Scholars?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: Is exaggerating in lauding the scholars with different titles before their name allowed in Islam?\nAnswer: Some scholars have warned against using a name that has a pronouncement of one’s integrity (tazkiyatul nafs) .  This is taken from the verse in Sura al Najm which states, “then do not pronounce your own integrity” [Quran 53:32].  Scholars such, as Imam Nawawi, disliked using names such as “Muhiy al Deen” (The One Who gives life to the religion) and he disliked it when people would call him using that title.  There are other scholars who have allowed such names and one can find a list of some scholars with such names in the book of Imam Zarnugi entitled Taleemul Mutallim.\nHistorical Examples of Honorific Titles\nImam Abu Hanifa is referred to by scholars as “Imam al Adham” (The Greatest Imam) and Imam Malik is referred to as “Imam Dar al Hijrah” (The Imam of the Abode of Immigration).  We also find that the scholars of have referred to such luminaries as Imam al Ghazzali as “Hujjatul Islam” (The Proof of Islam) and there are many other examples where honorific titles are given to great scholars.  So, as long as the title does not exceed the limits of the Sharia, there is no harm in using such titles to honor a scholar.\nSome Warnings about Honorific Titles \nIn the Book Kashhaf al-Qina`, the author says, “One should be careful of boasting about the integrity on one’s teacher as that could be a trick of the self to try to boast it’s integrity by default.”  By this he means that a person is essentially trying to say, “My shaykh is great and I am his student so that makes me great.”  So, although we should speak highly of our teachers, we should be careful that we are not doing it so out of boastful pride (fakhr).\nRami\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Should I Advise My Husband Islamically or Remain Silent?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: I recently found out I pregnant. I have been married for less than a year. My husband and I are overjoyed; however since being married and finding out I am pregnant, my husband stopped praying. He misses all his prayers. He argues with me on all matters of Islam, and ultimately, it is having a negative impact on me because i need his support and prayers as I am going through a tough time adjusting to marital life and the pregnancy. I feel as though i have no patience. What can i do to help him? Do i leave him to his own devices or do i help him?\n \nAnswer: May Allah grant you success in dealing with your situation.  Before giving advice and suggestions on how you can approach the situation, it is important to know the ruling regarding changing a wrong.  Any wrong (munkar), including leaving prayer, must be changed by a Muslim if one is able.  The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “Whosoever of you sees a wrong (munkar) must change it with his hand. If he is not able to, then with his tongue. If he is not able to then with his heart.”  \nThere are conditions to this changing though and they are 1) Knowledge that there is consensus about the prohibition of the matter at hand, 2) The belief that the attempt to change will be of benefit, and 3) That they changing does now lead to a greater harm.\nIn terms of the first condition, you know that there is consensus about the obligation of the prayer.  Now you have to see if there is a benefit for you to mention something to him. If there is, even if it requires many times until he gets the point, then you have to work towards that.  If you feel there is zero benefit to your urging him to pray then it is not an obligation to work towards the change.  We must be careful though in allowing ourselves a way out by saying that there is no benefit in changing the wrong.\nIn terms of helping him see the right, one of the best things that you can do is lead by example.  Make sure that he sees you do wudu and pray.  You can also send him inspirational articles and videos that you may find he would benefit from.  You have to use wisdom in choosing what to send him and when.\nYou know your husband’s temperament and you would be the judge of how much and how often to remind him. Another important thing to remember about calling to the good is that you have to work incrementally.  The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) ordered Muadh ibn Jabal to focus on calling the people to tawheed when he sent Muadh to Yemen and said that once the people are firm in their faith to work on the prayer.\nBased on this, I would say that you should work on helping your husband strengthen his faith. As you see his faith grow, then start incrementally with encouragement about the prayer.  Do not worry about all the other details of the religion that he is not accepting, since faith and prayer are the most important.  The people once complained to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) about a young man who they said he did every wrong action around.\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) told them to not worry about the young man because he prays with him in congregation and this would cause him to leave those foul things.  Eventually, the young man left all foul things because of the prayer and Allah says, “Indeed prayer prohibits indecency and foul things” (Quran 29:45).\nMay Allah grant you success in working towards providing a spiritual place to bring your child into.  The most important part of your “nesting” will be creating a space where your child can grow spiritually.  Have sincerity in your endeavor, trust in Allah, depend on Him, leave things ultimately to Him, and you will find success.\nRami\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Is It Permissible to Buy and Sell Cats in the Maliki School?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\n Question:  Upon discussing the issue with some non-madhab following brothers, there appears to be an opinion within this group saying that the purchasing of cats is haram. They cite an opinion of the Maliki school and say that it should not be done. \nIs there any prohibition in purchasing cats as pets? And is this ‘Maliki’ position reliable?\n \nAnswer:  According to the Maliki madhab, it is permissible to sell and buy cats.  In the Mukhtasar of Khalil in the first section on the rules of Transactions he says, “It is permissible to purchase a cat or a predatory animal for its skin.” (وجاز هر وسبع للجلد).  In the commentary (Hashiya) of Dusuqi, he mentions the words of al-Banani who said, “As for a cat, it is permissible to purchase it to derive benefit from it living or dead according to the apparent understanding of the Mudawanna, and this is what al-Mawwaq explained it as.  This is in contrast to the apparent meaning of the author.”  By “author” he means Khalil as in the Mukhtasar it says that you can purchase a cat to use its hide and it would leave someone to think that if there was a purchase for other than the hide it would not be permissible.  But, as al-Banani clarified, purchasing a cat is permissible.\nوأما الهر فيجوز بيعه لينتفع به حيا وللجلد على ظاهر المدونة وبه شرح المواقخلافا لظاهر المصنف\nAnd Allah knows best.\nRami Nsour\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: What can I do if I have broken an oath of ibada? I made an oath to fast every second day and I was not able to continue. Do I have to start again doing every second day or is there an expiation I can do in this case? I have heard that if its an oath to do with a promise to do a certain ibada then you must fulfill it?  Also, this is too many fasts for me to make up, so what should I do? \n \nAnswer: To begin, an oath to make a non-obligatory action (nafila) obligatory is called a Nadhr (نذر) and is recommended to do if it is a one time act.  If the nadhr is to do something on a regular basis, then it is disliked (makruh) according to the Maliki school.  In any case, once a person makes the nadhr oath, then they complete it or pay an expiation (kaffara) if they do not do it or break the promised habit.\nIf the nadhr was a regular fast and not fulfilled, then the person would have to pay an expiation (kaffara) even if the person went back to the fasting.  Additionally, once the nadhr is broken and the expiation is paid, then the nadhr is no longer binding.  The expiation (kaffara) is one of three methods:\n1) Feeding ten poor people each a mudd (0.5 liter measure) of a staple grain (it is recommended for those outside of Medina to give 1.3 mudds to each miskeen), or giving them each two loaves of bread weighing two Baghdadi ritls for each loaf, or satiating each poor person (miskeen) with two separate meals for each person.  The definition of a poor person (miskeen) according to the Maliki madhab is a person who does not have food for more than one day.\n2) Clothing ten poor people.  For each man a thobe is given.  For each woman a thobe and and hijab.  A child may also be included in the ten.\n3) Freeing a slave as a person would do in dhihar.\nIf all of these three are not a possibility for the person, then a person can fast for three days consecutively.\nAnd Allah knows best.\nRami Nsour\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Wearing Pig Skin in the Maliki School",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: In the Maliki school, what is the opinion regarding wearing pig skin? Do prayers need to be repeated when somebody’s foot has come into direct contact with pig skin contained in a shoe? \n \nAnswer:  In the Maliki school, pig skin is considered impure even if it has been tanned.  If a person has pigskin clothing on while praying or they move an item that is pigskin while in prayer, then the prayer is invalid and must be repeated. Your foot would not become impure by coming into contact with the pigskin unless some part of the leather was rubbed onto your foot.\nOne thing to point out it that it is not permissible to wear or use pig-skin like a wallet, belt, shoe insole, briefcase or jacket.  The prohibition of use of pig-skin is in addition to the prohibition of buying or selling it. [Ahmed al-Dardir, Sharh al-Kabir]\nRami\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "A Follower Praying a Different Prayer than the Imam in the Maliki School",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion:  In Morocco when there is rain usually the Maghrib and the Isha prayer are combined in the mosque. The adhan for Maghrib is called outside the mosque and right after the maghrib prayer the adhan for isha is called inside the moque and isha is prayed.\n \nIn his case he joined the prayer assuming it is maghrib but he was late and instead of joining the maghrib prayer he joined the isha prayer. So he prayed the isha prayer in congregation without having prayed maghrib.\n \nShould he pray maghrib and isha again?\nAnswer: According to the Maliki school, a condition for the validity of prayer for one following an Imam, is that the follower be praying the same exact prayer as the Imam.  So, a person praying Dhuhr cannot pray behind someone who is praying Asr.\nOne praying Dhuhr from his current day (adaa’) cannot pray behind someone making up a Dhuhr from a previous day (qadaa’).  This condition is referred to as “musawatun bis salat” and is mentioned in the section of congregational prayer in the Mukhtasar or Khalil.   Also according to this principle, someone praying a fard prayer cannot pray behind someone praying a nafila prayer.\nIn terms of the person who unintentionally prayed Maghrib behind the Imam praying Isha, the prayer of the follower would be invalid.  Thus, the follower would have to repeat the Maghrib and Isha prayers.\nAnd Allah knows best.\nRami\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Repeating Prayers in Maliki School for Not Doing “Dalk” in Wudu",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: I just learned that it is obligatory to pass one limb over another limb in ghusl. Do I have to pray for all the years that my ghusl was not sound? Do these prayers become qada?\n \nI would like to have this answered according to the Maliki school.\n \nAnswer: I have personally brought this issue up to one of my shuyukh while I was studying as this situation does happen often.  People who have not formally studied may go for years not realizing that they are missing something integral and sometimes even serious students or even scholars may overlook something.\nIn your situation, there is room within the Maliki madhab to allow for you not to have to repeat those prayers.  The reason for this is there is a sound Maliki opinion that passing one limb over another (dalk) is not an obligation (see the shuruh of the Mukhtasar in the section of the obligations of wudu).\nFurthermore, dalk is not an obligation in the Shafi’i and Hanafi schools and this should be considered by a person when they analyze past actions that may be deficient.  This analysis though should be done with the guidance of one trained in the science of law (fiqh).  Because you were leaving dalk not realizing that it is an obligation according to the school, your previous acts of worship are valid.\nIf you would like to make them up out of wara (leaving matters of difference of opinion) then you can do that as a spiritual practice.  But you should not embark on that if it is going to cause you resentment.  If you feel happy about repeating those prayers out of wara, then do so, but remember it will be a big task that will take a while.

      "Question": "Joining Prayers Due to Rain in the Maliki School",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: What is the Maliki school’s position on combining prayers due to rain or bad weather in general, and what are the conditions to make it valid? We live in Florida and it rains here frequently in the summer. Also, even though some masajid are far, we travel in cars so there is not much of a hassle when it comes to getting wet or dirty from the rain and puddles.\n \nAnswer:\nThe Ruling of Joining Prayers due to Rain\nAccording to the Maliki madhab, it is a recommended dispensation (rukhsa mandubah) to join Maghrib and Isha at Maghrib time on the night when it is raining. Maghrib would not be delayed until Isha but rather you bring Isha forward and pray it after Maghrib. Joining of Dhuhr and Asr due to rain is not allowed according to the Maliki school.\nThe Conditions\nThe conditions for this dispensation is that this only be done due to rain, hail or heavy snow. The joining can also be done if there is both darkness (due to heavy cloud cover) and muddy pathways, but not if there is only one or the other.  This joining would be done in what is considered a masjid but not another place like a musallah or a school.\nThe Method of Joining\nThe call to prayer (adhan) would be given for Maghrib right after complete sundown and done on the minaret as usual.  Then Maghrib prayer is delayed a short while and followed immediately by Isha prayer.  The only thing that would be done between Maghrib and Isha would be a call to prayer (adhan) for Isha but done inside the masjid with a lower voice followed an iqamah.  No extra prayers (nafila) should be done between Maghrib and Isha.\n[Dusuqi, Hashiya al-Sharh al Kabir]\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

I have read in other sources that Imam Malik interpreted the commonly cited hadiths to be in relations to carving statues as they were still so close to the polytheistic culture and the worship of man-made idols.\nWould you clarify this matter please?\nAnswer: According to the Maliki madhab, 3-dimensional complete figure of creatures possessing souls are prohibited. If the figure is not complete (like missing arms), or it is not 3-dimensional, then it would be disliked (makruh). Thus, drawings of animals and humans would not be prohibited.\nThe Maliki scholars mention that if the drawing is going to be in a place where it is degraded, then it goes from being disliked (makruh) to being permissible (mubah) but not the best thing to do (khilaf al awlaa). An example of when this would occur is if the drawing of an animal is on a plate that will be eaten from or a rug or pillow that will be used.

On August 1 I will be moving out of the house I am in and moving my things to Rabat, but I will be traveling for about 3 weeks (and will be staying less than 15 days in every city I go to) and only plan on staying in Rabat for more than 15 days starting at the end of the month. My question is, starting August 1, do I consider my place of residence to be Rabat or the city that I am currently in? I will be in Fes insha’Allah in the last week of Ramadan and so if I my place of residence is Rabat I would be a traveler in Fes, but if my place of residence continues to be the town 60km from Fes I would not be considered a traveler in Fes. \nAnswer: As soon as you leave a city with the intention of moving away, you are no longer a resident of that city. Once you move into a city with the intention of becoming a resident, you can no longer be considered a traveller when passing through that city.\nSo, in your case, once you get your housing in Rabat, every time you pass through it on your journey, you would lose the status of a traveller while in Rabat.\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: Is there a difference between how the Malikis and Hanafis recite the adhan??\nAnswer: There is a slight difference between the Maliki and the Hanafi adhan. The main difference is in the number of times the pronunciations are done. In the Maliki adhan, the statements are made twice each.\nInstead of four takbirs at the beginning, there are two. Additionally, there is a repeat of the two tashah-huds. So the complete Maliki adhan is as follows;\nAllahu akbar (twice)\nAsh-hadu an la illah illa Allah (twice in a lower voice)\nAsh-hadu anna Muhammadan rasul Allah (twice in a lower voice)\nAsh-hadu an la illah illa Allah (twice in a voice louder than the first time)\nAsh-hadu anna Muhammadan rasul Allah (twice in a voice louder than the first time)\nHayya alla salah (twice)\nHayya allah falah (twice)\nAllahu akbar (twice)\nLa illaha illa Allah (once)\nAnother difference in the iqama is that the Malikis do all of the pronunciations of the adhan once each except for the two sets of takbirs, which are kept at twice each.\n[Khalil, Mukhtasar]\nRami Nsour\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: According to the Maliki Madhab, during Ramadan, if a female believes she is at the end of her monthly menses can she take ghusl and make intention to fast prior to fajr? What does she do if she still has her menses after waking up later in the day, if she has made intention to fast?\nAnswer: A woman on her menses is only required to check before she goes to sleep. She does not have to wake up at the end of the night to check before fajr and actually to do so is disliked. If she happens to wake up before fajr and find that her menses are over, then she must make the intention to fast that day.\nAs long as the menses are still present, then a woman may not take a full shower (ghusl) with the intention of purifying from the menses. She must wait until the menses are fully gone before taking a full shower (ghusl).\nIn terms of fasting, an intention to fast while the menses are still there is not valid. The menses must have stopped before fajr for a woman to intend to fast that day. If it stops before fajr and she knows that, then she can make an intention to fast even if the full shower (ghusl) is done after fajr.\nIf one has to take a shower after fajr, they should be very careful not to swallow any water.

      "Question": "Can an Unmarried Young Woman Live Alone?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: My question is regarding whether an unmarried young woman can live alone. If someone is trying very hard to be good to her parents but cannot seem to gain their love and compassion or affection, and is a victim of emotional abuse, what can she do? Can she move away from her parents?\nBy abuse I mean yelling and name calling, indecent looks from the father towards his daughters, the father disconnecting from the daughters and making them and their mother feel guilty for not being financially independent from him. The mother and father also shame each other and try to involve the children in their fighting. Both of the eldest daughters have emotional and physical imbalances (depression and suicidal thoughts, low self-esteem, migraines from high levels of stress, and sleeplessness) partly resulting from and aggravated by this situation. It is an atmosphere of intense suspicion and stress.\nI should mention that there hasn’t been any physical punishment of the children for many years and that both parents work hard to maintain the family financially.\nAnswer: As salamu alaykum,\nMay Allah make your situation easy and give you the strength to deal with it. The Messenger of Allah (sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam) said,\nلا ضرر و لا ضرار\n“There can be no harm nor reciprocating of harm.” (Muwatta)\nIf you are being harmed by being at home, then you have the right, and possibly obligation, to leave the house if you are able. You would then be obligated to maintain contact with your parents and family in whatever is feasible for you (in-person, phone, email, text, mail, sending gifts etc).\nDaughter Staying at Home\nIf a parent if not harming their daughter, then they can say that she has to live at home until marriage. But, if they harm the daughter, then they don’t have the right to demand that nor does the daughter have the duty to obey. Sometimes, when you separate, it will allow the relationship to heal, but maybe after many years and some disagreements.\nThe Emigration (Hijra)\nThink about the Hijra of the Messenger of Allah (sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam). He had to leave Mecca and it made his family angry and they fought him. But it took him leaving for them to realize who he was and then come to respect and accept him. Everyone will experience aspects of the seera in their lives, and thus everyone will have to make a hijra, or even multiple hijras. Maybe it is time for you to make your Hijrah.\nAnswers Are Based on What is Presented\nI can only answer based on what you describe so I give you the answer according to that. You then have to see if the answer applies to your situation and then you make the decision. I cannot make the decision for you.\nRami Nsour\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Letting Garments Hang Below Your Ankles in the Maliki School",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: Is it permissible to let your garment below your ankles according to the Maliki madhab.\nAnswer: If a man wears his garment below his ankles out of pride, then there is no doubt that this is prohibited. If he does not intend that, which is the case for most people today who do that, there is a difference of opinion between it being prohibited, disliked or merely permissible. The majority of scholars of the four madhabs say that it is not prohibited. You do not have to repeat any prayers that you did while your garment was below your ankles.\nThe Hanafis\nIn Al-Fatawa al-Hindiyyah, it mentions that Abu Hanifa had an expensive shawl and would wear it below the ankles. Someone said, “Weren’t we forbidden from doing this?” He said, “That is for the people who are arrogant and we are not from amongst them.”\nThe Malikis\nIn Shaykh Al-’Adawi’s commentary on the Risala of Ibn Abi Zayd, he discusses the two opinions in the Maliki madhab one prohibiting the matter and the other considering it disliked. He says, “In conclusion, there are varying narrations about this matter if the garment is worn below the ankle without the intention of arrogance. According to the conclusion of Al-Hattab, there is no prohibition, rather it is disliked. According to the Dhakhira [of Imam al-Qarafi], it is prohibited. What the correct opinion seems to be is that it is extremely disliked.”\nThe Shafi’is\nImam Nawawi, in his commentary of Sahih Muslim says, “It is not permissible to wear the garments below the ankles out of arrogance. If it is not done out of arrogance, then it is disliked. The apparent meaning of the Hadiths show that the prohibition is specific to those who do this out or arrogance.” Some of the Shafi’is, like Al-Dhahabi and Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajar, chose the opinion that it is prohibited.\nThe Hanbalis\nAccording to the Hanbalis, as is found in the books Al-Iqnaa’ and Al-Mughni, it is considered disliked. Ibn Taymiyya also chose that it was disliked.\nAdvice\nWe are a middle nation and thus we must maintain middle ground. We should not allow our communities to be split over this issue, nor should we make it an issue when there are much more important issues to deal with. At the same time, we should not look down upon the sunna or those who follow it. For those who have the strength to follow the sunna of keeping the garments above the ankles they should do so. At the same time, we must not make this such a central issue that the religion is reduced to the length of your garment or your beard.\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Did the Maliki Jurist Ibn Abi Zayd Believe Allah is Literally Above the Throne?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: Assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullah\n \nAfter studying for a while and increasing my understanding in many issues, one issue still causes me confusion, and that is the issue of Allah and the ‘Arsh. I accept the verses of the Qur’an as they are about this matter and do not even translate them but accept them “bi la kayf”. However, I came across a translation of Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani’s Risalah. In that translation it mentions on page 18: “He is upon His glorious throne by His essence, yet is in every place by His knowledge.”\n \nThe main confusion I have is over the expression “bi dhatihi”. Why did the Shaykh mention this in this way. As far as I know, no verse of the Qur’an or Hadith uses this expression. I have asked two scholars about this issue but neither of them explained it. Also, I feel a bit uncomfortable about asking as Imam Malik censured a questioner for asking about the ‘Arsh. I just want an explanation of why al-Qayrawani used this expression. I only know a tiny bit of Arabic so I cannot access the Arabic commentaries.\n \n \nAnswer: This is a very good question and one that is essential for all serious seekers of knowledge to know what the scholars have said about this.  The line that you are referring to from the Beliefs portion of the Risala of Ibn Abi Zayd is one that has caused numerous discussion among scholars and students from past and present.  The line, in most available copies reads, “And He [Allah] is above the Throne al majeed bi dhatihi.”  I have left untranslated the words “al majeed bi dhatihi” because that is where there must be a discussion.\nAllah is Not Contained by a Direction\nThe main problem in the line is that it could lead someone to believe that Allah is in a direction, which goes against the belief of Ahlus Sunna wal jama’ah.  Imam Al Tahawiyy says in his widely accepted book on the beliefs of Islam, “He [Allah] is not contained by the six directions” [Al-Tahawiyy, Aqidatul Tahawiyya].  Some of the Maliki scholars, such as Sidi Ahmed Zarruq, have said that the line in the Risala that indicates Allah being in a direction (above the Throne) is something that was added in by deviant people and it was not part of the original manuscript [Zarruq, Sharh al Risala].  This is one explanation for the line that is given by the commentators of the Risala.\nMetaphorical Aboveness\nIf we are to assume that Ibn Abi Zayd actually wrote the line, then the explanation given by the Maliki scholars is that he meant “above” in a metaphorical sense and not a literal sense.  In other words, that Allah is above the need of the throne or that He is above it in grandness.  They say that Ibn Abi Zayd could not have meant it in a literal sense because that would make him from the people that believe Allah to be in a particular direction, which is a deviant belief.  We know that Allah does not resemble creation and that directions are a part of creation.   One of the most basic principles of belief is that “Everything that you can conceive, Allah is different than that.”\nWhy Would Ibn Abi Zayd Use the Word “Above”?\nSidi Ahmed Zarruq, may Allah be pleased with him, said that one of the explanations of why Ibn Abi Zayd would say that Allah is “above” His Throne is that there were people at in his time that believed Allah to be on earth. These people were the ‘Ubaydiyyah, also known as the Isma’ilis, and were deviant in many aspects of their belief and practice including believing that one of their rulers was God.  Therefore, Ibn Abi Zayd was using this line to teach people that Allah is not on earth and he is above, in a way similar to the slave woman who was asked where Allah was [Zarruq, Sharh al Risala].\n“Al Majeed bi dhatihi.” Honorable Owner or Honorable Throne?\nAnother issue with the line is understanding where the adjective of the word honorable (majeed) is linked to.  If we say that Honorable is an adjective to the word Throne, then the line would read as, “And He is above the Honorable Throne in His essence.” This would be a very strong statement indicating that Allah, in His Essence, is above the Throne and we would have to go through our list of explanations for the use of this  phrase. But, if we look at the word Honorable as an adjective for Allah, the line would read as, “And He, Honorable is His essence,  is above His throne,” and it would not be as easily interpreted that Allah is literally above the throne.  To decide on what it is an adjective for, we can look at the ayah in 85:15 where Allah uses “majeed” to describe Himself and not the throne.  Since Ibn Abi Zayd was using many verses and Hadiths in his section on creed, we would use the verse from the Quran as a guide to understand the grammar of the text’s line.\nAbove in the Quran\nOne thing to note is that although the line in the Risala uses the preposition “fawq” in Arabic to describe Allah in relation to the Throne, nowhere in the Quran do we find this preposition used with the Throne.  In the Quran, all the verses that speak about the Throne use the preposition “ala.”  So, if one is to stay true to the texts of the Quran and Hadith, saying “fawq al arsh” is not acceptable.  Many people that believe Allah to be in a direction use the line of Ibn Abi Zayd as a proof.  The response should be that we use the verse as it is and say “ala”.  Then, we have to understand that the prepositions can have literal and metaphorical interpretations.\nOne place where the preposition “fawq” is used is in the verse 48:10 but it is not in relation to the Throne.  The people that believe Allah to be in a direction say that this preposition of  “fawq” (above) is metaphorical, yet when they read the preposition “ala” for the throne, they say it is literal and that Allah is literally on His throne.  They have contradicted themselves by allowing metaphorical interpretation sometimes and other times not.  Contradiction is a sign of falsehood as truth does not contradict itself (Quran 4:82).\nOne last thing I would like for those who believe Allah to be in a direction to ponder on is the nature of our universe.  When a person stands upon the earth and says that Allah is in a direction and points up, that up is the down of the person on the other side of the earth.  So, if Allah is up for you, does that mean that He is below the person on the other side of the Earth?  Allah is exalted above what people falsely ascribe to Him.\nRami Nsour\nRelated Answers:\nHow Do We Understand the Hadith Stating that Allah Descends to the Lowest Heaven in the Last Third of Every Night?\nWhat Is Our Stance Regarding the Statement of Some That Allah “Sits” on the Throne?\nIs There a Way to Physically Describe Allah?\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Details Regarding Being a “Wali” for Marriage in the Maliki School",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion:  I have a few questions relating to what it means to be a “Wali”. From my understanding, a Wali for a convert is a Muslim male guardian, and I understand that some madhhab’s don’t “require” me to have a Wali, but I’m still missing quite a bit of information regarding this subject.\n \n1. What are the Wali’s responsibilities?\n2. What are the responsibilities of person X to a Wali?\n3. How does one “pick” a Wali?\n4. If an Imam conducts the marriage ceremony for a convert, does he automatically become her Wali if she doesn’t have anyone yet?\n5. What is the Maliki view on having/requiring a Wali?\n \n \nAnswer:\n1.  There are various types of a Wali, such as those who are entrusted with the care of orphans and the Wali in terms of a marriage.  In terms of a Wali’s responsibility towards someone they are representing in a marriage, that Wali must insure that the marriage is suitable for the woman and that the contract insures she be treated fairly.  The Wali’s position is over once the marriage is complete and he does not have a legally binding (fiqh) responsibility but the rules of good conduct (akhlaq) would entail that he continue to ensure that someone he married off is being treated well.\n2. There are no responsibilities of person X towards their Wali.\n3. Person X can choose whoever they want to be their Wali during the marriage contract.  The person also can change who they want their Wali to be.  The only requirement for the Wali is that he be an adult Muslim male who has knowledge of the rules of marriage, knows what is good for the person he is marrying off based on the culture of the people, and that he be free from outward deviance (fisq).\n4.  If the Imam conducts the marriage, he would be the Wali.\n5.  In the Maliki school, a woman must have a Wali present at the contract for the marriage to be sound.  If a woman does not have a Muslim male relative, then she can choose a Wali from amongst the Muslim men as long as he is knowledgable and trustworthy.\n[Dusuqi, Hashiya Al Sharh al Kabir]\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Words of Divorce and Dealing With Abuse in the Maliki School",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion:  My husband is addicted to pornography and music. He does not want to stop.  Once I found that he watched obscene stuff on his computer, so I hid it, but I told him that i threw it away. Hearing this he got very angry and asked me to leave him and go away if I have a problem with him. Does this count as a divorce? After that he called his parents and said that he wants to divorce me. Did that constitute divorce? \nMy husband and his family also make rude remarks about my height and make fun of me. I began to feel that he doesn’t love me and I don’t want to be a burden on him , so I told him I will observe idda for three months and during that time he can decide whether he wants to keep me or leave me. Please advise me on this.\n \nAnswer: \nDoes Saying “Leave Me and Go Away” Count as Divorce?\nMay Allah give you patience to bear and accept this test in your life.  To answer your question, a divorce is dependent on the intention of the husband. So, if he were to tell you to “go away” and did not intend divorce by that, then it is not a divorce and you do not have to go through an iddah. If he made the intention for divorce, then it would be binding. You should ask him if he intended a divorce and if so how many did he intend. [Dusuqi, Hashiyatul Sharh al Kabir]\nDoes Discussing Divorce Count as Divorce?\nAs for him discussing with his family that he would like to divorce you, that also does not count as a divorce.  Merely discussing the idea of divorce does not count as a divorce.  One way that divorce is binding is when a person says the words “divorce” to his wife in English or in any other language (such as “I divorce you” or “You are divorced”) and this would be binding even if he did not intend divorce.\nThe second way is to have an intention to divorce, even if he did not say the word “divorce.” An example would be like if he said, “Go away” or “go back to your parents” and intended by this divorce.  If he was only saying it out of emotion but did not intend it, then it would not be a divorce. [Dusuqi, Hashiyatul Sharh al Kabir]\nMarriage is Meant to Honor People\nOne thing that you should remember is that marriage is there to protect people in terms of faith, finance, and dignity.  If at any time you feel there is harm and you cannot reconcile the differences, then you should consider seeking a divorce.  You have to consider your safety in terms of spiritually, mentally and physically.\nIf a person is in a place where they are being humiliated they must move away from that as the Messenger of Allah said, “It is not befitting for a believer to belittle himself.” The Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, asked, “And how would he humiliate himself?” He said, “He faces a tribulation more than he can bear” [Tirmidhi and others].\nConsider the Future of Abuse\nYou should think about your own health (spiritually, mentally and physically)  and the health of your child.  You may be thinking that you are staying in the marriage for your son, but you have to find out whether staying will actually harm your son more.  As humans, we learn by imitation.\nWhat is your son learning about how to treat a wife? How will he treat his wife when he gets married? There is a lot of research showing that this can start a vicious circle of transfer of abuse.  You should seek more advice (shura) from other scholars, family and professionals and then pray istikhara before making your decision.\nPornography and Abuse are Diseases\nYou have to also realize that a person addicted to pornography is dealing with a serious sickness and addiction   He needs professional help and counseling unless he makes a sincere tawba that turns him away from that entirely.   His abuse of you (whether physical, verbal, mental, or spiritual) is also something that he needs help for.  If he is not willing to get outside help, then you must seriously consider going through a divorce.\nYour Sustenance is With Allah\nFinally, remember that your sustenance (rizq) is with Allah and do not have a fear of not being provided for.  Your decision to stay with your abusive husband who is addicted to pornography should not be based on a fear of not being provided for.  Some women stay in an abusive relationship because they feel they have no other choice and can either not live unmarried or they won’t be able to find another husband.\nWhether or not you find another husband, Allah will provide for you. So, do not base your decision on the fear of not being provided for.  You have to make your decision based on what is best for you and your son. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “Every one of you is a shepherd and every one of you will be asked about his flock” [Muslim].\nAnd Allah knows best.\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Consuming Alcohol in Foods in the Maliki School",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: As salaam alaikum,\nIn relation to the question about alcohol in bread, what is the Maliki opinion on ingredients like spirit, cider and balsamic vinegar and vanilla essence/extract in foods.\nI’ve been told that these are liquid intoxicants that affect the intellect (before being added to the food) and so, the entire food becomes impure.\nWhile it is easy to find out if food is vegetarian it is very difficult to find out if food has been prepared with mayonaise, balsamic vinegar, ketchup, soy sauce etc, vanilla etc without being rude to hosts.\nAnswer: Balsamic vinegar and all other types of vinegar are considered pure in the Maliki madhab as they have lost the intoxicating ability of wine (Khalil, Al Mukhtasar). In terms of flavorings that use alcohol as a preservative, they are not pure according to the Maliki school and would make any food they contact filth. One thing to remember is that food is considered to be pure until proven impure.\nIn the Hanafi madhab, liquid intoxicants are not impure as long as they are not made from grapes. Thus you will find many Muslims who do not take issue with eating foods with alcohol based flavorings. Because this valid difference of opinion exists, one would not be able to prevent others from eating foods that have alcohol based flavorings in them. You may gently encourage them to leave matters there is a difference about.\nSee the following Answers for more on this topic\nAlcoholic Content in Soft Drinks \nIs Beer Battered Shrimp Halal? \nWhat is the Ruling on Using Solid Intoxicants as Flavor Ingredients in Foods?\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Where Should One Look During Prayer in the Maliki School?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: What is the maliki position on where the eyes should be when sitting and standing while praying?\nAnswer: According to Imam Malik, one has the face towards the Qibla as Allah says, “So turn your faces towards the Sacred Mosque” (Quran 2:144).  So, during sitting and standing, one would face the Qibla. During the Ruku, one looks straight down.\nAlthough there is a sound Hadith saying that one should look at the place of prostration, the reasoning of Imam Malik is that to abrogate or set a condition to an ayah would require a proof as strong as an ayah. You can have a strong Hadith (sahih) but if its chain is single (ahaad), then it cannot abrogate an verse of the Quran which is at the level of mutwattir and thus stronger than ahaad.\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "A Summary of the Non-Obligatory Prayers in the Maliki School",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykha Mona ElZankaly and Saira AbuBakr\nQuestion: Assalaam alaykum,\nI wanted to know the Maliki opinion for sunnah rakats for each fard prayer. I have been given different information regarding the sunnah prayers for Dhuhr and Isha, specifically.\nAlso, what are the amount of sunnah prayers to be performed for Jumah?\nJazak Allah khayr.\nAnswer: Walaikum salaam wa RahmatuAllah,\nJazakuAllahu khairun for your question.\nThe witr prayer is the only daily confirmed sunnah prayer, in the Maliki school. The other daily non-obligatory prayers that are prayed immediately before or after the five obligatory prayers are considered confirmed nafilah (nafilah muakkadah). The exception to this is the fajr prayer i.e. the two non-obligatory rakahs that are prayed before the dawn obligatory prayer (subh prayer). These two rakahs fall under the category of raghiba. This category is considered below a sunnah but higher than a nafila. There are no other prayers in this category.\nSummary of the non-obligatory prayers:\n2 before the Subh prayer (Fajr prayer) Ruling: Raghibah\n4 before Duhr and 4 after Duhr prayer. Ruling: Nafilah Muakkadah\n4 before Asr prayer. Ruling: Nafilah Muakkadah\n2 (but ideally 6) after Maghrib prayer. Ruling: Nafilah Muakkadah\n3 Witr prayer- Ruling 2 shafi-Nafilah Muakkadah; 1 Witr-Sunnah Maukkadah\nSunnah Mukkadah/ Confirmed Sunnah: Voluntary prayers that Rasul Salla Allahu alayhi wa salaam never left and always performed.\nNafilah: Voluntary prayers that Rasul Salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam sometimes preformed and sometimes left.\nRaghibah: The word essentially means desirous and it is the ruling giving only to the two rakahs before the obligatory dawn prayer. It is given this name as Rasul salla Allahu alayhi wa sallam encouraged us to perform it.\nThere are no specific recommended nafilah/sunnah prayer for Jumu’a rather it is makruh (discouraged) to pray nafila after completing the Jumu’a prayer in the masjid (until people have dispersed/time has come for them to disperse and it is best to pray nafilah at home). It is haram to perform nafilah once the Imam has entered the masjid to deliver the sermon (khutbah). So one would not perform the greeting masjid prayer (tahiyyatul masjid) if one comes late.\nThe nafilah/sunnah prayers are prayed two rakah at a time, not 4 rakah at a time. If one mistakenly adds a third rakah one would complete a fourth rakah and perform two prostrations of forgetfulness before saying the salaam.\nBelow is what has been mentioned in the two main texts (Mukhtasar Khalil is the text that contains the dominant opinion of the school):\nThere is a general recommendation for the supererogatory(nafil) prayer (all the time). The recommendation is confirmed (takkadah) after the sunset (maghrib) prayer and (in general) after all (five) daily prayers, but specifically before and after dhuhr and before Asr without an (upper) limit such that if a person did two or four or six he has fulfilled the original recommendation.\nHaving said this, it is better or more complete (worship) that one performs four before and after dhuhr (due to what has been narrated in the prophetic traditions), four before Asr and six after maghrib. Furthermore, there is a confirmed recommendation for praying the morning prayer (Duha). The least of it is two, six is the middle number, eight is the upper limit and any more is considered makruh. (Taken from Al Sharh al Kabir on Mukhtasar Khalil)\nIt is recommended to pray two rakahs after maghrib and if one does more then it is beneficial (khair). There is a general recommendation to pray nafila prayers between Maghrib and Isha. Prophetic narration: The one who prays six rakahs after maghrib and does not utter vile speech between them, is equated with (a reward) of 12 years of worship.

Is this mandoob or makhruh like the janaza prayer?\n(Also our community is majority Hanafi and all the janaza prayers take place inside the mosque [however the body remains outside]. I was unaware before Sheikh Rami’s lecture that it was makhruh to do so. Should I avoid praying the janaza prayers because it is makhruh or continue to do so?)\nAnswer:\nEid in the Masjid\nPrayer in the masjid for Eid is a disliked innovation if there is not a need. The Messenger of Allah (sal Alalhu alayhi wa sallam) never did it. The only exception to this is praying in Mecca at the Kaaba. A reason could include, rain, heat, fear of bandits, etc. (Dardir, Sharh al-Kabir)\nChanging of the Ruling\nIf a masjid can go to a park or open space to pray then it would be makruh to pray in the masjid. If a valid reason is present, it would not be makruh to pray at the masjid. If your community has decided to pray at the masjid due to a need, then you can pray with them the Eid without it being disliked.\nSolutions\nIf you feel there is not a need, then you can pray Eid on your own and then join in the festivities with them. You can also choose to follow them in their opinion of praying at the masjid (Eid Prayer in a Masjid Behind a Shafi’i ). The important thing is to not isolate and marginalize yourself from the community while at the same time not compromising your practice.\nJanaza in the Masjid\nJanaza in the masjid is makruh if you can avoid it. If leaving the janaza or sitting while they pray will cause issues, then you can pray with them.\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

But during the last 10 days of Ramadan I prefer to stay awake for more late night prayers and recitation of the Qur’an. By doing so I attend the congregation for tarawih with the Imam and miss out the witr and then perform it late at night. Is this valid?\nAnswer: If you prefer to pray more than what the Imam leads for taraweeh, you may choose not to pray witr behind him. You would pray witr at the end of the amount of prayers that you perform during that night.\nThe only time that it is not permissible to skip praying with the Imam, is if he is the regular imam of the place of prayer and is performing an obligatory prayer (fard). The reason for this is to prevent people from feeling as though one is deliberately trying to avoid praying behind the regular imam and thus cause a division (fitna) in the community.

      "Question": "Maliki View on Stopping Eating 10 Minutes Before Fajr in Ramadan",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: If one follows the madhab of imam Malik, is it permissible to do imsak, i.e. stop eating 10 to 15 minutes before the time of fajr comes in.\nEvery Ramadhan the local mosque adds an extra column to the prayer times schedule. Next to the fajr times it says imsak. Imsak is about 10 to 15 minutes before fajr time comes in. I’ve been told that it is not obligatory but recommended to stop eating around this time.\nIn some online fatwas this is mentioned as being an act of extremism and an innovation in Islam. Although these Shuyukh do not represent the Maliki madhab, I’m still uncertain of the truth. What would be your advice concerning this matter?\nAnswer: In the Maliki madhab it is recommended to stop eating a short time before the entrance of the dawn (fajr) time. This is based on the action of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) who would stop eating before dawn the amount of time it would take to read 50 verses. \nIf a person were to eat right up until the entrance of dawn, the fast would technically be correct but they would have left the recommended Sunna. Once should exercise caution though in eating close to the dawn time.

      "Question": "Praying Nafl Prayers When You Have Make Up Prayers in the Maliki School",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: As Salaamu Alaikum:\n \nIn the Matn of Al-Akdhari it states that it is not permissible to perform Nafilah prayers if you owe make up prayers. It specifically states Taraweeh and Ad-Dhuha as examples of those that are not permissible to pray. The text, however, does not have anything about the nafilah that are connected to the fard prayers (with the exception of the two rakas of Fajr as being permitted to pray) or Taheeyatul Masjid. Are these Nafilah of those that aren’t permissible to pray while owing Qad’aa or would they fall under the category of those that remain permissible to pray such as Shafi and Witr…\n \nAnswer: \nA Note About Maliki Terminology for Prayers\nIn the Maliki school, there are four types of prayers and each have a specific definition.  The first are the obligatory prayers which are referred to as fard or wajib.  The second, which are the highest level of non-obligatory prayers, are referred to as sunna.  The sunna  prayers are those that were regularly performed by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) but there was not an indication that they were made obligatory.  The third category of extra prayers are referred to as raghiba and are above nafila and below sunna in degree of reward.  The fourth category are referred to as nafila and they are prayers that were done by the Prophet (sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam) regurlay but sometimes skipped by him.\nMake Up Prayers and Supererogatory Prayers\nIt is mentioned in the Text of Al-Akhdari that a person who has to make up missed obligatory prayers (qada) may not perform extra (nafila) prayers.  Although the Text of Al Akhdari uses as examples the nightly Ramadan prayers (Taraweeh) and the mid-morning prayer (Duha), the ruling applies to all supererogatory prayers (nafila).   This would include the extra prayers done before and after the obligatory (fard) prayers. The prayer to greet a masjid (Tahiyatul Masjid) is also considered a supererogatory prayers (nafila) and would not be done when a person owes obligatory prayers.\nWhat May be Performed by the One Who Owes Prayers\nThe only extra prayers that a person could pray when they have to make up obligatory prayers are the raghiba and sunna prayers. In the raghiba category, there is only one prayer which is the two rakas of fajr before the obligatory Subh/Morning prayers.  The only prayers that are sunna are the two Eids, Witr, the drought prayer (istisqa), and the solar eclipse (kusuf) but not the lunar eclipse (khusuf) as the lunar eclipse is a nafila.  The two raka’s of Shafi before Witr are technically a nafila but are allowed to be prayed with the Sunna of Witr.\nFard in Place of Nafila\nOne thing to note is that is would be permissible and even recommend to use make up prayers (qada) in place of when a supererogatoy prayer would be done.  So, instead of praying the Nightly Ramadan prayer (taraweeh) as a supererogatoy prayer  one would just do that amount of make up prayers. One would pray a make-up prayer when entering a masjid or during the mid-morning time (duha).\n[Mukhtasar al-Khalil and commentaries]\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Breaking One’s Fast by Masturbation and the Emission of Pre-Ejaculate in Maliki School",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: As-Salāmu `Alaykum\nBefore converting to Islam I masturbated regularly. I understand it is prohibited in Islam and I have tried to cut down. However, sometimes I slip into old habits and give in to my desires.\nMy question is, in Ramadan, if one was to masturbate in the Maliki school would they have to pay a kaffarah i.e. feed 60 people? I’m aware that I would have to make up the fast at a later date.\nI also wished to ask that does the emission of madhi voluntary or involuntary require someone to do ghusl in the Maliki school, or would ablution suffice? Would this too invalidate ones fast?\nI apologize for asking such questions, but I couldn’t ask this openly to my teachers.\nAnswer: No apology needed about asking this question as blameworthy modesty is that which prevents on from asking questions about the religion. You have taken a great step in asking this question.\nPenalty (Kaffara) For Ejaculation of Fluid\nIf one were to intentionally cause the ejaculation of sexual fluid (many or madhy) during the daytime of a fast, then that fast would be invalid. The person would have to make up that fast and pay a penalty (kaffara) which would be either fasting 60 days consecutively, feeding 60 people or freeing a Muslim slave. One kaffara would be done for every day that was broken. (Khalil, Al-Mukhtasar)\nCowper’s Fluid (madhy)\nThe emission of madhy would only require washing of the entire penis and would not require a full shower (ghusl). The emission of madhy would require wudu and would invalidate the fast if the person did something intentionally to cause it to come out. If one knows that by looking, thinking or touching that madhy will exit and it does, then the fast is broken and must be made up. (Dusuqi, Hashiyatul Sharh al Kabir)\nAdvice to Break the Habit\nI advise you to seek whatever help you need in breaking the habit that you have formed. Regular fasting throughout the year can help you do this. Recitation of Sura Al Tariq also aids in prevention of this type of habit (Zarruq, Naseeha). A reduction in tasty foods may also help. Delaying the shaving of the pubic hair will also reduce desire, but it should be shaved at least once every 40 days. One should never look or touch the private area unless there is need, such as cleaning after urination, and should do so in as short time as possible.\nRami\n*Note: In the Hanafi school masturbation resulting in ejaculation invalidates the fast but doesn’t require expiation (kaffara). Rather, it is obligatory to (1) make up the fast and (2) sincerely repent.\nRelated Answers:\nIs Expiation Required for Masturbating While Fasting?

      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: As-salāmu ʿalaykum. I just discovered that normal bread, which is leavened, contains alcohol as a by-product. Does this then mean that, according to the Mālikīs, all leavened breads are ḥarām to consume? Also, allegedly unleavened bread also contains trace amounts of alcohol. Would these trace amounts be ignored or are they significant?\nAnswer: Eating leavened bread would be permissible according to the Maliki school. As for the concern about the content of alcohol, there may be trace amounts produced during the process of the dough rising, but trace amounts of alcohol do not make something impure. There are trace amounts of alcohol in ripe fruit even while it is still on the tree yet there is no doubt about the permissibility of eating fruit.\nIt is important in this discussion to take into consideration the Maliki definition of intoxicants (muskir) when discussing what it impure (najas). Liquid intoxicants are liquid, impair the intellect but not the body, and cause energy and happiness (Dardir, Sharh al Kabir). If one of these conditions are not present, such as something being solid, then it would not be considered impure.\nLeavened bread does not fall under the definition of what a intoxicant would be because it is solid and one cannot be intoxicated by eating it. As for the trace amounts of alcohol, we are not taken to account to look for them nor do we have to avoid them. There are trace amounts of alcohol in many other permissible foods, such as certain yoghurts. If the amount becomes noticeable by one being able to become intoxicated if they were to consume it, then it would be impure. An example of this would be certain fermented milk that can intoxicate a person.\nAnd Allah knows best.\nRami Nsour\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Does Accidentally Eating Break Your Fast in the Maliki School?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: Assalamu alaikum wa Rahmahtullah,\n1) Is it true that Imam Qurtubi Al-Maliki was of the view that accidentally eating/drinking something in the obligatory fast, does Not break the fast?\n2) Are their any other Maliki Scholars that had this view?\nAnswer: 1) In his tafsir of the Quran (2:187), Imam al-Qurtubi did in fact prefer the opinion that accidentally eating while fasting does not break the fast. Although he said that this is the correct opinion and used the same reasoning of Imam Shafi’i and others, his position is not the madhab of Imam Malik.\nAccording to Imam Malik, if a person accidentally eats while fasting, it breaks his fast and he would have to make it up. The opinion of Imam al Qurtubi would be valid to follow as it corresponds to the opinions of other madhabs but a person following that opinion would not be following the Maliki position on this matter.\n2) I am not aware of other Maliki scholars that held the same opinion but there may be. Even if there are though, those Maliki scholars that hold that opinion cannot consider it to be from the madhab unless one of the mujtahids of the mahdab, such as Ibn al Qasim, held that opinion and can prove it through the principles or another narration of Imam Malik.\nReasoning in a madhab\nThe reason for this is that when you have an explicit text of the mujtahid imam of a madhab, the followers of that madhab have to go with that text. Even the mujtahid within a madhab has to base his opinions on the opinions and reasoning of his imam just as the imam of the madhab bases his opinions on the Quran and Sunna (Muhammad al Khadir, َQam’u ahlul Zaygh wal Ilhad).\nUsing a Hadith in Ijtihad\nIn this case Imam al Qurtubi in this matter, he used a Hadith to prove the strength of his opinion and not the text of Imam Malik or his principles. If a person is to follow a Hadith for action, they would have to do so through one of the four agreed upon Imams.\nWhile it is theoretically possible for a person in any age to reach ijtihad, the permissibility of following a mujtahid mutlaq (complete mujtahid) is that there is consensus about his level (Sidi Abdullah, Maraqi as Su’ud). There is only consensus about following the ijtihad of the four imams. Imam Suyuti claimed complete ijtihad and the scholars of his age refuted his claim.\nIjtihad in our age\nIn this day and age, there are many people who claim ijtihad at various levels, with some even claiming complete ijtihad. Some of them claim their ijtihad is in all areas while others claim they are mujtahid in one matter (mas’alah). The question that one should ask of those who make this claim is at what level of ijtihad are they.\nAre they at complete ijtihad such as Imam Malik or Abu Hanifa? Are they a mujtahid within a madhab like Ibn al Qasim from the Malikis, Abu Yusuf from the Hanafis, or Al Muzni from the Shafi’is, none of whom claimed complete ijtihad? Or are they a mujtahid of tarjih like Al Maziri from the Malikis or Nawawi from the Shafi’is, both of whom did not claim complete ijtihad?\nIt would be a difficult claim for one in our age to be like any of these aforementioned scholars. Safety in faith relies on following what is clear and in following the well known positions of the widely accepted scholars.\nAnd Allah knows best.\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Advising My Father to Keep a Beard",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: I know it is disrespectful to tell your parents to do thing,  but I also know it is sunna to keep a beard and it is highly disliked to shave the beard. Is there a way that I can tell my father to keep his beard without being disrespectful.\nAnswer:\nThe Sunna of the Beard\nBefore answering your specific question, it is important to understand that the scholars have valid difference in regards to the obligation of keeping a beard. Some of the madhabs, including the Maliki and Hanafi, have considered keeping a beard on the entire jawbone to be an obligation. Other scholars, such as some of the Shafi’is, have considered that it is a Sunna and to shave it would be disliked but not prohibited. Because this valid difference of opinion exists, one would have to be gentle in advising of keeping a beard.\nEnjoining Righteousness (Hisba)\nOne of the three conditions to enjoin righteousness (hisba) is that there be consensus on the matter that is being enjoined. If there is a valid difference of opinion, then one must take a different approach which is called advice (nasiha) and must use more gentleness in the method (Dardir, Hashiyatul Sharh al-Kabir). For more on the conditions of Hisba see the following answer: The Criteria of Enjoining Good and Forbidding Evil\nHisba with Parents\nImam Malik was asked about how a person goes about enjoining righteousness with a parent and he said, “He does so but also lowers the wing of humility” referring to verse 17:24 (Mawlud, The Rights of Parents). Normally, not angering a person is not a condition of Hisba but in the case of the parents, it is. Imam al Ghazzali in the Ihya, when speaking about enjoining righteousness, also mentions that a condition of this when dealing with the parents is that they do not become angry.\nNoble Speech\nAllah ordered us to speak kindly to our parents and to use “noble speech” when speaking with them (Quran 17:23). Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib was asked what constitutes noble speech to which he responded, “The way a meek slave who has committed a crime would speak with his harsh and majestic master” (The Rights of Parents, Mawlud). So, imagine you are that slave and you wanted to advise you master about following the sunna of keeping a beard, how would you approach the topic? Or would you approach it at all?\nIn conclusion, if advising one’s father to keep a beard will make him angry, then it is prohibited to do so.

      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: What is the Maliki ruling on calling the Adhaan & Iqamaah in the ears of newborn children?\nAnswer:\nImam Malik on Calling the Adhan and Iqaama in the Ears of a Newborn\nAccording to Imam Malik, the practice of calling the Adhaan & Iqamaah in the ears of newborn children is disliked (makruh) due to the fact that he did not find it as a practice in Medina. Imam Malik was very careful about considering something a sunna if there was not proof that the tradition was maintained by the scholars of Medina. Later Maliki scholars recommended implementing the practice due to the Hadith and this has been accepted as the practice of many of the Maliki scholars. (Al Hattab, Mawahib al Jalil)\nImam Malik, the Practice of Medina and the Madhab\nAlthough the opinions of Imam Malik and the Practice of Medina represents a large amount of the Maliki rulings, there are many opinions of the Madhab that are from Malik’s students or later Maliki mujtahid Imams. Thus, when one follows the Maliki madhab, or any of the four valid schools of thought, they are not only following the opinions of one scholar but rather the opinions of a large group of scholars using similar methodological principles.\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Is Friday Prayer Valid in a Rented Space in the Maliki School?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: According to the School of Imam Malik, is one’s Jumu’ah valid if prayed in a rented space as opposed to a Masjid?\nAnswer:\nConditions of a Mosque for Friday prayers\nAccording to the Maliki school, one of the conditions for the Friday Prayer (jumu’ah) to be valid is that the building be owned and designated as a Mosque. The building also has to be equivalent to the dominant living structures of an area (Khalil, Mukhtasar).\nExamples of Prayer places not sufficient for Friday Prayers\nThus, a rented space would not fulfill the condition of being a valid place to hold Friday Prayers according to the Maliki school. Similarly, a building not designated as a Mosque as an endowment until the Day of Judgment is not sufficient to hold Jumu’ah in. Lastly, a building such as a portable structure in an area where people have brick houses would not be sufficient to pray Jumu’ah in.\nCommunity Cohesion\nThe Friday prayer is a integral part of maintaining community cohesion. Therefore, every community needs to facilitate the prayer and community members must attend. If one is in a community where the mosque does not fulfill the conditions according to the Maliki school, those following the Maliki opinion must strive not to make the issue an issue that causes division within the community.\nI personally advise Muslims in prison not to leave the Friday Prayer if they are Malikis and to perform the prayer according to the Hanafi school of thought. This is because the Friday Prayer for Muslims in prison is especially essential to identity, inviting others to Islam and community cohesion.\nAdvice\nA person following the Maliki opinion may choose to attend Friday Prayers that do not fulfill the conditions according to their school, and then they can make up four units of Dhuhr prayer privately without making it obvious. A Maliki may also choose to follow the valid opinion of another school, such as the Hanafis or Shafi’is that would allow for a Friday Prayer to be valid in a rented space.\nAnd Allah knows best.\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

Carmine is a crimson pigment derived from the pulverized bodies of cochineal insects.

[Khalil, Al-Mukhtasar]\nThe production of Carmine, by collecting the Cochineal insects and soaking them in hot water, does not seem to fit the conditions of making them fit for consumption.

      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: Salam,\nI live with my parents. They have always been strict and very difficult to deal with. I am losing patience to a point where I wish to ignore my parents and avoid them. They demand money from me. They want control of all my money. I used to give them money before I started graduate school, but explained to them it is difficult to give them money now and otherwise I will be forced to take interest loans. They say they don’t care and they want me to take interest loans so I can give them money. I help with expenses and help with other things but they strictly want cash from me. They are not poor but they still demand money. They are very upset with me when I don’t give money to a point where they verbally abuse me and make me feel like I am a horrible daughter. I have always been obedient.  Most of my issues have started since I began working. They believe I am hiding money for some reason and lying that I need money to pay school.\nI am not sure what to do, please advise.\nAnswer: May Allah give you patience to deal with this difficult situation. Always remember that you have rights and your parents have rights. You have to be patient while to trying to make sure that you fulfill their rights without angering them unnecessarily while at the same time not compromising your rights.\nIf a parent does not have wealth and is unable to work, it is the duty of the children to financially support the parents. This financial support is whatever is within reasonable means of the child or children. If the parents are at a financial state that is reasonable for them, the child is not obligated to give them financial support.\nIf a child wants to give anything extra to the parents, that would be a great charity containing a lot of reward. If the child does not have any money, then he or she would not have to do anything prohibited to get that money. Taking on interest bearing loans would be a major prohibited act (kabira) thus you would not have to do that to get money for your parents.\nIn all your dealings with your parents, uphold the best character even if they are angry with you. Your reward will be with Allah.\n[Mawlud, The Rights of Parents]\nI encourage you to take the following course on The Rights of Parents: The Rights of Parents\nAnd also review some of our answers to people in situations similar to yours:\nInterest, Parents, & Upholding Good Character \nDealing With a Dysfunctional Relationship With Parents \nAdvising My Father to Keep a Beard\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Is It Permissible for a Woman to Grow Long Nails and Shape Them?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Saira Abubakr\nQuestion: Assalamu alaikum warahamathullahi va barakathuhu\nIs it permissible for a woman to grow her nails and shape it just to make her fingers look longer and not in any other intention of showing off?\nAnswer: Walaikum salaam wa RahmatuAllah,\nIt is permissible, per se, for a man or a woman to grow his or her nails. However, the Messenger of Allah, peace and prayers be upon him is reported to have maintained short nails. Hence, growing out nails would be considered going against his blessed practice, peace and prayers upon him.\nThe recommendation is to clip them every Friday. It is reprehensible (makruh) in the Maliki school to leave them unclipped for 40 days or longer. (Risalah of Ibn Abi Zayd al Qarawani)\nIn addition, it is makruh tahrimi (sinful) in the Hanifi school to leave them for 40 days or longer.\nThe minimum practice would be to clip them such that they no longer cover the tips of the fingers. Covering of the fingertips by the nails could prevent water from reaching the specified area during wudu. Water not reaching a portion of the limb would render the wudu incomplete and possibly invalid.\nIn the Risalah of Ibn Abi Zayd AlQarawani, the Shaykh mentions five acts under the chapter of Fitra. Fitra acts are those that, when performed, complete the person’s outward appearance. One of these is clipping one’s nails.\nSome scholars recommend starting with the right index finger (shahadah finger) then the right middle finger till one completes the right hand (except for the thumb) then one moves to the left hand starting with the pinky finger, then the ring finger and so on ending with the left thumb and then finally the right thumb (in a circular fashion). However other scholars mentioned that it cannot be confirmed that the order of clipping was the practice of the Messenger of Allah, peace and prayer upon him.\nAnd Allah knows best.\nSaira Abubakr\nChecked & Approved by Rami Nsour\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

Will that also mean my uncle is now my mahram? \n JazakaaAllahu Khairan\n Answer: According to the verse in the Quran in Sura Baqara (2:233), “Mothers shall nurse their children for two complete years.”  The years here refer to lunar years.  From this verse the scholars have deduced that two years is maximum time that nursing can cause the mahram (non-marriageable) relationship.\nSome scholars, such as the Maliki scholars, have added two months to the two years. This is based on the principle that “proximity to something will incur the same ruling.”  Two months were deemed as being close enough to the limit to be given their ruling.\nBeyond this, nursing will not cause a mahram relationship to occur.  Thus, your father will not be considered to be the mahram of the caretaker who gave him milk when he was seven years old.  Since the mahram relationship did not occur, your “uncle” who is the caretakers son, will not be your mahram.\nAs a note, the Maliki scholars do not require that milk reach the child directly from the mother’s breast.  If the milk was given through a bottle, syringe, spoon or the like, that will be sufficient. But again, this would have to be before the 2 year and 2 month limit.\nAnd Allah knows best.\n[Mukhtasar Khalil]\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Is It Valid to Divorce Someone While Angry or During Menstruation?",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: Assalamu aleykum, I am writing as my husband has issued a 3rd talaq while I was on my menses. The second talaq was given 2 years ago also during a time of impurity. The first one was fine and during a time of purity. From what I have read on the Answers service I am irrevocably divorced. However, my husband has approached a local Sheikh who is contacting Darul Iftah in Saudi to get a fatwa issued to see if I am truly divorced based on the following points, is it really valid to do this?\nThe points the Sheikh will be considering are:\na) Husband was angry at the time. His speech appeared fluent and “normal” and his voice was not raised. He says the words “then I divorce you” just came out of his mouth and that it was not his intention at all, that he was not thinking about divorce at that time and that yes he was upset with me but that he had not intended divorce and he was shocked the words came out of his mouth. He says it was similar the last time, also he was angry and the words just came out, with no intention and they sounded read out, not like something one would say in a conversation.\nb) issue of me being on my menses\nc) extreme hardship that could be incurred as we have 4 young children and I am the primary caregiver.\nd) desire of both spouses to be together.\nIs it really valid to do this? I have fear of living in zina if the talaq is valid but the Sheikh says we are still married. Also this Sheikh we are told is qualified to do ijtihad.\nAnswer:\nMay Allah alleviate the pain and hardship that you are experiencing. To answer the questions you put forth:\na) According to the vast majority of scholars of the four schools of thought, the divorce of an angry person is binding. There are some that say that if a person’s anger caused them to lose sense of reality, then it would not be binding. This is because they have become like an insane person.\nThe opinion that is being quoted to you is that of Ibn Al-Qayyim Al-Jawziyya and his teacher Ibn Taymiyya. This opinion, that the divorce of an angry person is not counted, goes against what the four schools of thought teach, including the Hanbali school. The opinion of Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Al-Qayyim is specific to them, and only a few other people, and thus is not considered to be a valid opinion.\nThe Shafi’is say divorce in anger is binding, as is mentioned by Ibn Hajar in Fathul Bari in the discussion of the Hadith, “There is no divorce under compulsion (ighlaq).” The Malikis also say that the divorce of an angry person is binding, even if the anger is extreme [Hashiyatul Dusuqi in the Section of Divorce]. Some of the Hanafis have given a breakdown of what type of anger would prevent divorce from occurring. Please review this answer for more on that: The Ruling on Divorcing While Angry and Pronouncing Three Divorces\nThe majority opinion of scholars through history is that the divorce of an angry person is binding, unless the anger caused the man to lose his intellect. This loss of intellect due to anger would have to be ascertained by a professional. If the husband remembers the interaction, that is a proof that he did not lose his intellect.\nWhen analyzing what opinion you as a couple will take, you as a wife may end up taking a different opinion. This is not a situation where a wife must obey her husband’s decision. If your husband decided to take the opinion of Ibn Taymiyya, you may choose to take the majority and safer opinion and thus you would leave him.\nI cannot imagine the hardship you are facing. On the one hand you have children and a divorce would make your and their lives very difficult financially and emotionally. On the other hand, you fear living in a state of impermissible intercourse.\nThe Messenger of Allah said, “There will be people from my nation who will make permissible adultery, silk, alcohol and instruments” [Bukhari]. Imam al-Bukhari placed this Hadith in a chapter he titled, “Those who will use alcohol and call it by other names.” If a woman is truly divorced from her husband, then their relations are not permissible, no matters how many fatwas are issued that say their relationship is a marriage and not prohibited.\nb) According to the four schools of thought of the people of Sunna and Jama’ah, divorce during a woman’s menses is binding. It is not permissible to enact a divorce during that time, but it is nonetheless binding.\nc) You are correct in that you will experience extreme hardship, and may Allah may things easy. But hardship in this case does not affect the outcome of the ruling. We have to look at whether or not the conditions of divorce were present. If they were, then you are unfortunately divorced. If the conditions were not there, then you are still married.\nd) As in answer “c”, this factor is not taken into consideration in the ruling of divorce. To illustrate this, it is mentioned that if a husband was joking around with his wife and said he divorced her, then a divorce would have been enacted. Abu Hurayra (may Allah be pleased with him) reports that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “Three matters done in seriousness are serious and their being done jokingly are serious; marriage, divorce and freeing a slave.” [Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah]\nNote: Your husband (or ex-husband) must seek anger management counseling. His carelessness in pronouncing the words of divorce has put the whole family in a severe predicament. That is extremely selfish of him and he must take all precautions to never do this again. He must also follow the Shariah in setting his marriage to you right. If that means that he cannot marry you until you re-marry, then that is must what happen.\nAlthough a person usually does not divorce unless they are angry, the pronunciation of the words of divorce should be only done when a person is calm, collected and has asked the scholars the directions on how to implement a sunna divorce. This will prevent a person from doing something they will later forget.\nMost people will not take an exam unless they studied and are calm or file taxes unless they sought counsel, so why would someone pronounce divorce while ignorant of the rulings, repercussions and while in a state of anger?\nPlease contact us for any and all clarifications that you need.\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Joining Prayers in the Maliki School",
      "Answer": "\nAnswered by Shaykh Rami Nsour\nQuestion: What is the ruling on joining prayers according to the Maliki  teachings, is it strictly limited to times when traveling or is it  permissible at others times or under other conditions?\nAnswer: According to the Maliki madhab, it is a permissible dispensation (rukhsa) to join prayers while traveling.  The travel does not have to be one where the distance allows you to shorten the prayer, you merely have to be out of your city limits.  Once you are out of your city limits, and traveling to do something that is not disobedience, then you can either bring asr (or isha) forward or delay dhuhr (or maghrib) depending on your situation.  If you are in a resting place when dhuhr enters, and you intend to be traveling until maghrib, then you can bring asr forward. In the case of maghrib, if you are resting while it enters and you will then travel past fajr time, then you can bring isha forward.\nTo delay dhuhr or Maghrib, the following is the scenario; If you are traveling while dhuhr enters and you will continue traveling but will stop before maghrib, then you can delay dhuhr. If you are traveling while Maghrib enters and you will stop before Fajr, then you can delay Isha.\nSo, as an example, you are leaving Liverpool around noon to attend a program after asr in London. You are on the road when dhuhr comes in but you wont get into London to the masjid until after asr has entered. In this situation, you can delay dhuhr and pray it with asr in London.  On the way home, you leave before maghrib enters and then the sun sets while you are on the road. You will get back to Liverpool before  fajr and so you can pray maghrib with isha when you return.\nFor bringing them forward; you are travelling from Liverpool to London in the winter time. You stop for fuel when dhuhr is in and you wont get to London until maghrib. You can pray asr with dhuhr.\nTo illustrate using this dispensation in times other than when you shorten prayer: You live in Liverpool but you need to go to Warrington.  You leave before maghrib and the sunsets after you have left your city limits. You will be out and about the whole time in Warrington until you return but then maghrib will be out. You can delay maghrib and pray it with isha.\nRami\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\nOriginal Source Link\r\n\n",

      "Question": "Working for Intelligence Agencies in Non-Muslim Countries",
      "Answer": "\nWhat is the ruling of a Muslim working in the department of secret investigations for non-Muslims who track Muslims? Such a person claims to have the goal of helping Islam. I hope to provide him with the evidence for this ruling based on the opinions of the early and contemporary scholars. What should we do with this person to guide him to the straight path?\nThis job cannot be permitted. In fact, if a person works in these investigations, he will naturally cause harm to his brothers, because he works for a salary and thus he has to cause harm to his brothers or he will be considered as being disloyal by the others. In both cases he faces dangers, either in this world or in the Hereafter. Thus, we advice everybody not to take these types of jobs. We call upon every Muslim to be honest and never to be dishonest with those who trust him, be he a Muslim or a non-Muslim. Nevertheless, none should expose himself to such work that causes harm, either to himself or to others. Therefore, he should keep himself away from such things, as one poet said: To be safe from Salma and her neighbor, never pass by a valley that is next to her valley Accordingly, to be safe and in order to have good relations with both Muslims and non-Muslims, one should keep himself away from such work, and he should not take a job that causes harm to people or to himself. This job involves great danger. We can never give a fatwa for the permissibility of this job as its prohibition is apparent. However, we will not deem him as a non-Muslim if he does this job. We rather say that he thus commits an enormous, evil misdeed. Allah knows best.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

What is the ruling of the money I earned from this job after I quit it? May Allah reward you.\nAll praise is due to Allah. Peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah. In fact, this question lacks details. If the questioner intends by tourism working in hotels or in public parks or resorts, as is the case in these good countries, this job is not wrong as long as it involves no sin. But if this tourism involves evil practices and preparations for prohibited matters or for drinking intoxicants, this is prohibited. I cannot give an absolute ruling without knowing the issue in detail. If the job is to provide general services to the visitors of the region, whether Muslims or non-Muslims, this job is permissible, and then the salary you take is permissible. But if the job is totally or mostly prohibited, this is not permissible. Thus, if he is in need or poor, he may use this salary; but he has to look for another job, particularly if he is in a Muslim country, for these are not wholesome things. Considering the position of Abu Hanifah, we differentiate in some cases between working in Muslim countries and working in other countries. Hence, the issue lacks details. We advice the questioner to avoid sinful acts and prohibited matters in tourism and to take the side of innocent entertainment, for there is no harm in this as long as it involves no sin or illegitimate acts.

      "Question": "Women Praying with Men",
      "Answer": "\nIn the Name of Allah. Peace and blessing be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and his companions, all of them. Peace be upon you, along with the mercy and blessings of Allah. I live in a western country in a community with a good number of Muslims. Praise is due to Allah! We have a mosque where there is a place for women. But sometimes a woman or two come and pray with us in the place dedicated for men. Is this permissible? What is the ruling of this case, considering that there is no curtain between us and them? May Allah reward you! Peace be upon you as well as the mercy and blessings of Allah.\nAll praise is due to Allah alone. Peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah. And upon you be peace, together with the mercy and blessings of Allah. The basic principle is that a woman has to pray in the lines of the women. Having a curtain is not a condition, but it is more proper to have a curtain or a screen. In the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) women prayed behind men, as mentioned in the authentic ahadith, without screens or curtains. Sometime men’s clothes were not long enough and women were ordered not to raise their heads from prostration until men raised their heads first. There are undeniable hadiths to this effect. See Musnad Ahmad (22911), Saheeh al-Bukhary (362), Saheeh Muslim (441.) Moreover, in the noble Two Holy Mosques women pray in the lines behind men. But if a woman prays in the same line with men, this is not permissible. The point concerning the permissibility of women to pray behind men without a curtain is based on the purity of souls and the avoidance of dubiousness. Thus, women have to pray in the places dedicated for them, whether behind a curtain or not. If a woman prays isolated from men’s lines, her Prayer will be valid. But she should not mingle with men or be allowed to join their lines. Allah knows best.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Why Were Heavens and Earth Created in Six Days?",
      "Answer": "\nPeace be with you, eminent Sheikh. Please explain the divine wisdom behind creating the heavens and the earth in six days. This question was asked repeatedly during a conversation with some Hindus working here in Saudi Arabia. They wondered, “Could your Lord not create the heavens and the earth just by saying, ‘Be’ and then it is? Why did he not do that?” High be Allah above whatever they associate with Him. We ask you kindly to give us a thorough answer by showing the wisdom behind that. May Allah reward you with good and let Muslims benefit from your knowledge.\nFirst of all, Allah cannot be questioned as to what He does, while everyone else shall be questioned. They just do not know about the Lord. Questions are to be asked only to created beings, not to the Creator. With His Absolute Wisdom and Perfect Predetermination, whatever the Creator does or says definitely has some purpose.\nAlso, Allah wills to teach His creation through His own Actions. With that six-day origination, He means to give us a practical example of gradation and teach us that every existing being evolves. Just like a person grows up from babyhood to youth, maturity, and elderliness, it was Allah’s Decree that the whole universe comes into existence similarly, in stages.\nAlso, Allah willed that both time and space go hand in hand in the course of creation. Such six days, together with the seventh day, constitute the circle of time, which is governed and regulated by space. In turn, time had a basic role to play in the evolution of the world designed for us to live in. Therefore, temporal and spatial dimensions substantially integrate. Time is abstract, while space is material; so, Allah has made them interrelated. All such facts may be well beyond human perception, especially for those who are not insightful or believing in Divine Planning.\nIbn Al-Qayyim (may Allah confer mercy upon him) said,\nTell those with blind eyes that sunshine\nCan be seen only by perceptive eyes\nSuch souls are endowed with superficiality\nAnd lack the spirit to look into the essence\nAsk those Hindus: Why were days created? Why does time exist? This is all known only by the Creator, and the human being is too weak and too inferior to question his Creator. Allah says,{He cannot be questioned as to what He does, while they shall be questioned} [Al-Anbiya’: 23]. Everything Allah does has some wisdom, and if man cannot see it, this is his own problem. That is what I have to say in this regard, and Allah knows best.\n\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Woman Wants to File for Khul`",
      "Answer": "\nSomeone divorced his wife and after a few weeks he revoked the divorce. Now, she wants to file for Khul`, although he promised her he would not make the same mistakes with her again. Earlier, he had not given maintenance or due care to the family, and she had to pay for everything. She does not want to continue living with him, and she wants to know: Does her husband have the right not to grant her khul`?\nBasically, the husband has to provide for his wife. If she requests khul` (divorce on the request of the wife in return for the marriage dowry), while he provides for her, then he may or may not accept to give it to her, as believed by the majority of Muslim scholars. To illustrate, the husband is not obligated to accept a woman’s request for khul`, but he is recommended to accept it if his wife requests it, and he should not hold her within the wedlock against her own will. Thus, if she insists on requesting khul`, the judge shall intervene to identify whether it is the husband or the wife who has caused the discord. To that end, the judge shall appoint two arbitrators to investigate the case. Allah, Exalted be He, says, {Appoint (two) arbitrators, one from his family and the other from her family; if they both wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation} [An-Nisa’: 35]. Accordingly, the appointment of the two arbitrators is an important issue in Shari`ah. If it is found out that the reasons of the quarrel are wholly on the part of the husband, then divorce shall be effected; if it is on the part of the wife, she will be demanded to adhere to good marital practices. However, if no reconciliation could be reached, the judge shall request the husband to accept khul`. The majority view states that acceptance of khul` is not obligatory. In this respect, there is a hadith indicating that Thabit Ibn Qays was ordered by the Prophet (peace be upon him) to divorce his wife upon her request for khul`. The Prophet asked the wife, “Will you give him back his garden (transferred to her as the marriage dowry)?” She replied, “Yes!” The Prophet then told the husband to divorce her [Sahih Al-Bukhari, 5273]. This hadith implies preferability, not obligation.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Why Has the West Surpassed Us?",
      "Answer": "\nFor what reason has the West surpassed Muslims in all fields, while we have the gracious Quran with its innumerable treasures? Is it us who fall short of understanding the Quran? Why do we suffice ourselves with only eloquent words? We can analyze, use evidence and make refutations. But can we pace with the West and its progress in different fields?\nAll praise is due to Allah. Peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah. Almighty Allah has set laws for this universe. He says, “Whoever desires this [life of] haste, We shall hasten for him therein whatever We so will for whomever We intend.” [17:18] and says, “Whoever desires the tillage of the Hereafter, We shall increase for him his [reward for this] tillage. But whoever desires the tillage of this world, We shall give him of thereof.” [42:20] Western countries have observed these universal laws – the laws of hard and constant work, and rational means. They used these laws of advancement which are based on cultivating the land, as Almighty Allah said, “They cultivated the land and built it up [far] more proficiently than these [non-muslims] have built it up.” [30:9] Cultivating the earth is achieved through building on it, through inspecting it, searching for minerals and water, and through digging out its treasures. Whoever makes use of these laws will find results. The issue is not that we have the Quran and we do not understand it. It is our falling short of acting upon the injunctions of the Quran. The Quran commands us to work, “Say: Work.” [9:105] It commands us to give up laziness and to be ready with power, “So prepare for them all that you can marshal of power…” [8:60] We fall short of complying with and applying Quranic injunctions. Thus, the issue is clear; he who did not plant seeds cannot wait for a harvest. We cannot wait for the result without taking the introductory steps. These are the laws of Almighty Allah and expecting different results than these laws dictate is impossible. There are the injunctions of the Creator and the laws of creation. It is true that the West has been negligent and unmindful with regard to the laws of conduct; namely, with regard to answering the call of Almighty Allah with regards to their transactions and their relation with their Lord, but they have followed the laws of creation. A guided Caliphate is based on two aspects: the aspect of the universal laws of advancement, which is based on cultivating the earth, and the ethical aspect, which is based on, “And their messengers came to them with clear proofs” [30:9] as indicated in the verse that reads, “They cultivated the land and built it up [far] more proficiently than these [non-Muslims] had done. And their messengers came to them with clear proofs.” [30:9] They did not believe in what the messengers (peace and blessings be upon them) came with, but they cultivated the land and built it up. The reason is so clear. There must be diligence, order, system and hard work. There must be an innovative, not heretical, movement to deal with this universe. Without this we cannot build up the land in a perfect and guided way. Allah knows best.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Why Should We Not Get Closer to One Another?",
      "Answer": "\nIn this article we will temporarily cease our research on need and necessity, to handle the problem of communication between the Islamic community and its western surroundings. This week, I attended a conference in Istanbul held in response to an invitation from both the Turkish and British governments to study Muslim situations in the West. For my part, I looked to explain the oversensitivity that some segments of the European community have towards Muslim existence in the West.\nI attempted to present the problem as follows. The variety of people’s colors, languages and beliefs represents a sign of the divine power, just as the flowers and natural landscapes represent a sign that man enjoys. But man is not always able to enjoy the variety of his own kind: “And also (there are signs) in your own selves. Will you not then see?” (Al-Dhariyat51:20-21) Man is able to look around, but he seems unable to enjoy the variety of mankind.\nPerhaps this is the problem that drove this assembly of scholars and wise men to come to this city to study this issue. A number of questions must be asked: Why do we prevent ourselves from seeing the beauty in each other? Why do we feel unable to bear one another? Why do we not feel at ease with each other? Why does one cast the other outside of the earth and wish death upon him? Why do people kill one another?\nIt is despair, frustration and madness. It is man in his animal, primitive and brutal nature. When a man hates another, he will prefer animals over him. An Arab poet once said: “When a wolf howled, I felt company; but when I heard a human voice, I was about to fly.” Despite our ability to subjugate the chaotic universe through the advances forged in science, we have not been able to tame the aggressive nature of man. But, why this aggressiveness? Why bear malice? Are we not partners in life in this universe? Do we not inhale the same air and sustain on the same food? Is not our God one and our forefather one? This is what the heavenly messages, in which we believe, say.\nDo we not all love to live and to be happy and hate death and unhappiness? If so, then what is the problem exactly? Is it the problem of having different values? Is it the problem of having different cultures? Is it perhaps the problem of real and unreal interests? Is it a case of inexpressible psychopathy? Or is it a problem of misunderstanding and xenophobia? Who is responsible? Can we say that all are responsible or that we are all innocent? There are many questions. However, firemen do not ask who lit the fire; they simply extinguish it. This is what we will attempt to do.\nParadoxically, many sound-minded persons, from both academic backgrounds as well as lay people, desire to change this situation. But the key to spiritual communication is still amiss. The crisis is one of communication. Thus, we are here to search for the key. We do not have a magical key; only words of wisdom and caution. We will not be able to provide a plan to disentangle the confused emotions; and even if we did provide such a plan, we will not be able to carry it out. What are going to provide? This is what we will attempt to answer in the coming article.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

For this reason, after about two years, I joined another company as Director of the Legal Department, whose tasks are to undertake and provide consultation to new establishments, including traditional banks, Islamic banks and companies with haram business activities such as trading in alcohol, managing nightclubs, etc. Is my current job halal or haram?

The questioner should try to return to his first job, as it is much better than his current work, which facilitates usury and has an evident basis of illegitimacy. The company helps in the foundation of firms that provide haram services such as alcohol, nightclubs, etc. Hence, his former work, where he reviewed contracts, is by far better than the company where he is working now. More preferably, we advise the questioner to look for a job at a Shari`ah-compliant bank or company or any other job that has nothing whatsoever to do with usury. The current job entails direct engagement in usury. Naturally, the farther one is from factors of illegitimacy, the better. Here, the current job has a closer relation to things which are haram than the previous one. Thereupon, we advise him to search for another job and leave this job.

      "Question": "Why Are Not Muslim Countries United?",
      "Answer": "\nThese days the Muslim nation suffers from insecurity. We call upon disbelieving countries to solve our problems and lift injustice. If European countries have their own armies and nonetheless joined NATO, why do Muslim nations not establish one strong army to protect their peoples against any external aggression and at the same time to stop the dangers they face. Then there will be no need to invite America or any other power to help. Is this a good idea?\nAll praise is due to Allah. Peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah. The issue you are talking about is vital. It seems that you have posed this question and presented these ideas because you believe in the importance of solidarity between the members of the Muslim nation. But we would like to say that solidarity between the members of the Muslim nation and between Muslim countries suffers from problems that are obvious to the naked eye. There are several reasons: First, Muslims’ negligence of the teachings of their religion, particularly those related to the social system as prescribed by Islam. Almighty Allah said, “And do not quarrel [among yourselves], or else you will become fainthearted and your strength depart.” [8:46] In a prophetic hadith Muslims are described as being like “one building whose parts reinforce one another.” [Reported by al-Bukhary (481) and Muslim (2585)] This solidarity took the shape of having one ruler and one sovereignty for the Muslim nation, known as the caliphate. This was the case before the ummah (Muslim nation) became divided on ethnical, racial and geographical grounds. Hence, the basic principle is that the ummah ought to be under one banner and one ruler. This is the basic principle prescribed by Islam. But the status quo shows that the ummah has been disunited for a long time, its enemies have grown significantly, and its magnificence has declined. Second, recession in the field of industries and other aspects of material progress.\nThird, the ceaseless, fierce campaign launched by the enemies of the ummah, especially western allies, under different pretexts – sometimes under the pretext of regaining Jerusalem from the Muslims through the crusade efforts, sometimes under the pretext of colonialism, and sometimes under the pretext of training the ummah and the enforcement of democracy. We should be aware of all of these. Nevertheless, questioner, in a moment of conscience after the eruption of the fire in Al-Aqsa Mosque in 1969, the Organization of Islamic Conference was formed to represent a sort of the solidarity which you and we all call for; but the international powers have been watching and weakening its influence and vigor to form a strong united Muslim front. Thus, the organization has grown weak and regional interests have gained precedence. But this organization still gives a hope for the unity and the federation you called for. Your suggestion is reasonable. The ummah should have one army to protect it. It needs no foreign armies or interference in any form. But, unfortunately, I have to say that these days, this strong federation is far-fetched, considering the circumstances we live in. However, we ought not to despair of Allah’s mercy “For, most surely, none despairs of Allah’s mercy except the disbelieving people,” [12:87] Also He said: “And who desponds of the mercy of his Lord but those who are astray?” [15:56] We still have the hope that every person in the ummah will work and try to achieve this solidarity, even through a good word, a useful economic project, or an idea that can help the ummah to get rid of colonization. This is all I want to say.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Can we ask, “Where is Allah?” and ask if He is high above His creatures? Is this a sort of anthropomorphism- may Allah save us from it? What should be our position toward those who disallow this question claiming that Almighty Allah is nowhere and that whoever says this is an anthropomorphist and a heretic?",
      "Answer": "\nCan we ask, “Where is Allah?” and ask if He is high above His creatures? Is this a sort of anthropomorphism- may Allah save us from it? What should be our position toward those who disallow this question claiming that Almighty Allah is nowhere and that whoever says this is an anthropomorphist and a heretic?\nAlmighty Allah described Himself as being high. He said, “Highly exalt the Name of your Lord, the Most High” and said, “He is the Most High and the Most Great.” Thus, none can doubt that Almighty Allah is high and it is not permissible for a Muslim to say otherwise. But you cannot ask “How”? In a hadith Ahad (a Hadith which at some point in the chain has only a single narrator, a man wanted to emancipate his slave girl and thus he came with her to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), who said to her, “Where is Allah?” There is no other report where the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) asked this question. None of the salaf (early pious predecessors) asked this question. Thus, such kind of questions is not required. You should read the verses of affirmation and the verses of negation. The verses of affirmation are to be perceived as they are. The verse of negation is “There is nothing that is anything like Him.” You should not engage in such matters, for they are of no practical benefit. On the Day of Resurrection Allah will ask you about your deeds, not about His Divine Self. Thus, you have to believe in the characteristics of Allah. This was undeniably the position of the salaf. Al-Tufi said, “The position of Ahmad and all other prominent scholars among the salaf is to regard them (the characteristics of Allah) as they are and not delve into them, and to keep silent.” None should say anything in this regard, as Abu Nu`aym, Sheikh al-Bukhary, said. Explaining the verse that reads “Then He settled Himself over the Throne. He causes the night to enveil the day.” [7:54], Ibn Kathier quoted him as saying, “We should regard  them as they are and not delve into them, believing in the transcendence of Almighty Allah over anything that comes to one’s mind.” These are the words of Abu Nu`aym, Sheikh al-Bukhary, Ahmad and Yahya ibn Ma`een. Hence, to disagree over such an issue and stir up arguments about the place and time of Allah’s actions was not a norm of the salaf. This, rather, disagrees with their norms. You should say nothing. Just read them as they are. You have to have the same belief the salaf had – no more, no less. Read the verses that affirm the highness of Almighty Allah. You say in your Prayer “Glory be to my Lord, the Most High.” In negation you read “There is nothing that is anything like Him. And He is the all-Hearing, the All-Seeing.” This is what is required from you and do not engage in futile arguments. Allah knows best.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "When Shared Interests Become a Bridge for Cultural Dialogue",
      "Answer": "\nIn the previous article we spoke of the need to focus on the common ground between our Islamic civilization and other civilizations. This includes the religious values shared by the followers of heavenly messages: “Say: (O Muhammad) “O People of the Scripture! Come to a word that is just between us and you“.” (Al-Imran 3:64) And: “Say, “We believe in what has been revealed to us and revealed to you. Our God and your God is One, and To Him we have submitted (as Muslims)“.” (Al-Ankabut 29:46)\nWe said that the western civilization is ultimately Christian, as Hunter Mead said: When we say ‘Christian’, we mean from a philosophical aspect ‘monotheist’. Believing in one God, Who governs the universe He created, is the basis of religious thought in the West. These orders – the divine orders – are comprehensive and apply to all people anywhere.”\nThis belief is common, as the Christian clergyman Hans Kwing observed with regard to the Jews, Christians and Muslims in particular. According to Kwing, faith means that man, with all the power and intelligence given to him, is unreservedly and unconditionally committed to comply and to have trust in God and His words.\nWe will conclude this series on the principles of dialogue and civilizational meeting points with the field of reciprocal interests. These include the issues of trading of raw and manufactured materials, energy, free exchange within the frame of the trade organization and international agreements.\nThus, interaction has multiple dimensions and ends that include values, culture, interests, economy, and politics. The political dimension could give support to the cultural and in turn, all of these dimensions could bolster one another to reach a real understanding.\nThe fifth and final step is to train oneself to the techniques of discourse and the arrangement of arguments. Rationality is the most important aspect of dialogue. Therefore, each of the parties of a dialogue should be aware of the cultural, dogmatic and intellectual premises of the other in order to employ the proper language. By language we do not mean the translation of words, which in itself is important to avoid confusion in the corridors of terms. Rather, we refer to a deeper dimension of language. We mean here that each party should have a firm background understanding of the other’s culture that goes beyond words to appreciating their spirit of civilization, philosophical principles, as well as social and historical development.\nI remember that once, while I was in a dialogue with some western officials, I made reference to a “western dance”. I thought this dance to be of Italian origin and used it as evidence for the importance of partnership, a matter that gained their admiration and to which they showed no objection. However, when I later checked the encyclopedia, I found the dance to be of Spanish origin. These seem trivial details to an Arab party and they may be so; but they constitute a sort of formal communication that may develop into actual communication. Finding a communication language that comprehends the cultural and philosophical backgrounds is not a luxury, but a necessity.\nHere I would like to point out that on the basis of the experience I have, the Islamic party in dialogue often lacks competence with regard to philosophical and legal issues that would make its vision clear to the other party. Similarly, therefore, being acquainted with the religious principles of the other from their sources could be beneficial in rounds of religious dialogue.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "What of those to Whom Islam Does Not Reach",
      "Answer": "\nAll praise be to Allah. May blessings and peace be upon our Prophet; and upon his Family, Companions\nand followers. To proceed:\nThe beginning of your question may be whittled down to: Has Islam reached the whole of humanity?\nThe reply: Islam has not reached the whole of humanity, but it will reach the whole of humanity. For\nthere occurs in one hadith: “The Hour will not be established until there remains no house of brick or\nfur save that the religion will enter it: bringing with it honour or humiliation.” Related by Imam A˙mad\n(no.16957), al-Bayhaq• in his Sunan (9:181) and al-Tabarån• in al-Kab•r (no.1280). Hence this religion\nwill certainly enter [everywhere]. Today the media and the means of mass communication have turned\nthe world into a global village; such, therefore, are channels for Islam to be conveyed to every house.\nThus it is incumbent upon each Muslim to strive diligently to communicate Islam to others. But as for\nwhether or not this has [completely] happened, then not as yet.\nAs for those deserving of punishment in the Hellfire, it refers to those to whom this religion has been\nconveyed but they refuse to believe in it. Allah, Transcendent and Exalted is He, says: And this Qur’an\nhas been revealed to me that I may warn you with it and whomsoever it may reach.1 Meaning, that it\nis a warning to all whom it reaches, even if one has not seen or spoken with the Prophet. Whosoever\nthe Qur’an has been communicated to, is of those who have been warned. Consequently, the Qur’an\nthat is with each of us must, of need, be conveyed to the whole of humanity. Those to whom the Qur’an\nhas been conveyed, then the proof (˙ujjah) has been established upon them. Those to whom it has\nnot been conveyed, the proof has not been established to them, and their case is like that of the ahl\nal- fa† rah – those who lived in a period of time before the advent of a divinely-revealed message. About\nthis, Allah, Transcendent is He, revealed: Nor do We punish until We have sent a Messenger.2 He also\nsaid: Whenever a fresh host is cast into it [Hell], its keepers ask them: “Did not a warner come to you?”\nThey will say: “Yes, a warner came to us; but we denied.”3\nThus Messengers were divinely sent in order that mankind might have no argument against Allah after\nthe Messengers. So a person to whom the message has not reached, then the proofs cannot be said to\nhave been established; proofs and arguments that are to be clear, thorough and decisive: Say: “Allah’s\nis the decisive argument.”4\nSomeone to whom the message reaches may not affirm it due to either simply ignoring it (i‘rå∂an\n‘anhå), being prejudiced against it, being hostile to it, disbelieving it, or rejecting it – as Allah, Exalted\nis He, says: And they rejected them [the signs], though they inwardly recognised them, out of injustice\nand pride.5 That is to say, they rejected them whilst their souls were certain about them and inwardly\nknew them to be the truth. So they chose to be blind to the truth: But when they cover themselves with\ntheir garments He knows what they hide and what they reveal. He knows what is in their breasts.6 In\nother words, they desire not to see the truth.\nMany non-Muslims today fall into this situation, in that some of them are able to discern truths if they\nare made manifest. However, whether it is out of not wishing to forsake familiar habits; or losing their\nstanding among people; or having contempt for Muslims; or being prejudiced against them; or just out\nof sheer folly and misguidance, many turn away from even considering (or contemplating) the Qur’an.\nIt is this turning away from contemplating the Qur’an or becoming acquainted with the message, while\nbeing able to do so, which undoubtedly causes a person to be divinely punished. For: The religion in\nthe sight of Allah is Islam.7 Also: Whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it shall never be accepted\nfrom them, and they will be loosers in the Hereafter.8 Of course, a devotional life in this world should\nbe lived in peaceful co-existence with others; for no one can be compelled to accept the faith. Afterall:\nThere is no compulsion in religion.9\nThis, then, is our stance, and our address and invitation here. Yet this is not to suggest that the truth\nis multiple, and that everyone can [ultimately] believe whatever they want. For the truth is indeed one;\nthe truth is this religion: a religion that is the seal and guardian over all other religions. This, in brief, is\na reply to the question.\nENDNOTES\n* From www.binbayyah.net (trans. Surkheel Abu Aaliyah).\n1. Qur’an 6:19.\n2. Qur’an 17:15.\n3. Qur’an 67:8-9.\n4. Qur’an 6:149.\n5.

      "Question": "What to Do in Case of Disagreement?",
      "Answer": "\nDue to the multiplicity of scholars’ opinions in Fiqh, I have to ask: where does a Muslim stand concerning the disagreement of opinions between scholars, which is apparent in their Fatwas?\nA Muslim must seek to follow the preponderant position, which brings about benefit and wards off evil from the Muslims, and be supported by proofs at the same time. This matter requires great knowledge and understanding. If one is not knowledgeable enough, he has to follow the more knowledgeable scholars who are known for their piety, righteousness, and uprightness, and who do not give Fatwas hastily. When a scholar possessing these qualities gives a Fatwa to any Muslim, he should follow it and there will be no harm on him.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "When can a Muslim use violence?",
      "Answer": "\nWhen can a Muslim use violence?\nAll praise is due to Allah. Peace and blessings be upon him after whom there will be no other prophet. Violence is not required or desired in Islam. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “The Muslim is the one from whose hand and tongue Muslims are safe.” Reported by al-Bukhary (10) and Muslim (40) on the authority of Abdullah ibn `Amr (may Allah be pleased with them). He also said (peace and blessings be upon him), “The Muslim is the one from whose hand and tongue Muslims are safe; and the believer is the one with whom people feel secure with regards to their blood and properties.” [Reported by al-Nasa’I (4995) al-Termidhi (2627) and others on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him)] Thus, the culture of Islam is the culture of peace, not the culture of violence and aggression. Nevertheless, violence could be used. When there is aggression, one can fight back. Almighty Allah said “And whoever avenges himself after having been wronged – those have not upon them any cause [for blame]. The cause is only against the ones who wrong the people and tyrannize upon the earth without right. Those will have a painful punishment. And whoever is patient and forgives – indeed, that is of the matters [requiring] determination. [42:41-43] Violence is permissible only within the limits of resisting aggression. But if one remains patient when hurt and does not repay it back, he is described by Almighty Allah as complying with one of the foremost commandments of Allah that  must be kept with diligent resolve. Violence is not the basic principle in this religion. The basic principle is to call to the religion with fair means “Call to the path of your Lord with wisdom and fair admonition. And argue with them in the fairest manner. Indeed, it is your Lord who knows best those who have strayed from His path; and He knows best those who are guided aright.” [16:125] One more point I want to draw attention to is to ask the questioner: Violence with whom? Against whom? And in which context? These are very important points. It is necessary to balance between the possible benefits and harm when using violence. How many a case of violence led to more violence, and thus the reaction goes on endlessly! This violence then will be sinful and the others will have their share also in the sin of this violence; particularly violence directed to the ruler.\nIn Saheeh Muslim (1847) the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) is reported to have said to Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman (may Allah have mercy with him) “You shall listen and obey the commander. Even if he beats your back and takes your properties, you have to listen and obey.” This is because such kind of violence leads to more violence and chaos. Thus, violence is permitted only in certain and regulated cases in Islam and is not the basic principle in Islam. Rather, the culture of tolerance is the basic principle.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "We Are Childless.. Can We Adopt a Child?",
      "Answer": "\n I live in France, and I am married to a French Muslim. She could not get pregnant, and we are thinking of adoption as a way to relieve our longing for having a baby. French laws prohibit bringing children from abroad for this purpose. So, is it permissible for us to adopt a kid here and give him our family name while our family and the child himself know that he is not our kin?\n\nAll praise is due to Allah, and peace and prayer be upon the Messenger of Allah.\nWe really sympathize with the questioner, but we would like to inform him that adoption is expressly prohibited in the Glorious Qur’an. Allah, Exalted be He, says, {Call them (i.e., adoptees) by (the names of) their fathers. That is more just in the Sight of Allah} [Al-Ahzab: 5]. He also says, {Nor has He made your adoptees your own children. That is but your saying with your mouths. But Allah says the truth, and only He guides to the (Right) Way} [Al-Ahzab: 4].\nAdoption was a practice of Jahiliyyah (i.e., pre-Islamic periods of ignorance), and it has been invalidated by Islam. Child adoption leads to confusion of lineage and many consequent problems. It establishes a relation of kinship that cannot be established except by the Lawgiver (i.e., Allah), Who has specified forms and purposes of kinship and affinity. Accordingly, I advise the questioner and his wife to submit themselves to the indisputable Commands of Allah. In fact, Islam means submission to the Lord. Allah says, {When his Lord said to him, “Submit (i.e. be a Muslim)!” He said, “I have submitted myself (as a Muslim) to the Lord of the worlds”} [Al-Baqarah: 131].\nIt is important to note that fostering can be a better solution if relevant Shar`i guidelines are observed. A foster parent can bequeath a portion of his property to the fosterling and should treat him kindly and bring him up properly, as a foster, not biological, child. I think this may well be sufficient for the questioner instead of adoption, which is unquestionably prohibited by Shari`ah. And Allah knows best.\n\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "What is the ideal position for a Muslim to take when confronted with different scholarly opinions?",
      "Answer": "\nWhat is the ideal position for a Muslim to take when confronted with different scholarly opinions?\nThe Answer:\nWhat is obligatory is to investigate the correct opinion in every issue, and to investigate the opinion that actualizes benefits for the Muslims and protects them from harm as long as [that opinion] is not free of evidence [from the sources of Islamic Law]. This type of investigation requires insight, knowledge and a deep understanding. Thus, if one is unable to perform such a task, then what is asked of him is to follow, from amongst the scholars, one who possesses the most insight, knowledge and is known to be a person of piety and righteousness. In addition, such a scholar should be known as one who does not haste in giving religious edicts, nor does so without knowledge. Therefore, [if one finds] a scholar who gives religious edicts who acquired the above mentioned qualities, then he [the questioner] should follow that scholar’s opinion and there is no blame on him in doing so.\nDr. Abdullah Bin Bayyah\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Waqf in Western Countries",
      "Answer": "\nI was asked to write on this subject, which is of extreme importance as it constitutes a significant means to preserve the identity of Muslims in the West and to secure suitable conditions so that they can practice the rites of their religion.\nIntroduction\nThis brief paper on endowment in the West aims to manifest the importance of endowment in Western countries.\nTherefore, we shall talk about Muslim minorities, the aim of this paper, and about the obstacles that face Islamic endowment in the West and the solutions, including the necessity of helping Muslims and the importance of achieving mutual solidarity.\nWe will look at the definition of endowment in Islam along with a quick comparison with the foundation system in the West – using France as an example – to form the proper concept of endowment in the West.\nEndowment has to be adapted to the Western environment.\nFirst: Muslim minorities\n“Minority” as a term was not known in the past. It emerged in the last century and has gained much strength since the beginning of the 15th Hijrah century with the establishment of Islamic organisations interested in the situation of Muslim communities in the West. The Muslim World League is the leading such organisation, followed by the Organisation of Islamic Conference. The word “minority” has grown to be used for a group of people with special characteristics who live among a congruent, larger group of people who wield more influence as they possess all or most of the power.\nMuch dispute took place about the term “the fiqh of Muslim minorities”. The European Council resolved this dispute in the round held in Dublin, Ireland, by approving the use of this term, as there should be no contention with regard to terms, and also as it was used in contemporary speech. In addition, the term minority is conventionally used internationally as a political term that stands for groups of people in a state who belong to a different ethnicity, language, or religion than that which the majority belong to. The Council also approved the opinion that the subject of the fiqh of Muslim minorities is the fiqh rulings related to Muslims who live outside Muslim countries.\nThe special characteristics of the minority could be religious or ethnic. Therefore, the majority usually tend to ignore the rights of this minority if not harass them, physically or psychologically, because they are bothered by the values and ideals of this minority. This is the most important problem that faces minorities; namely, how to balance between adhering to their values and achieving adaptation and congruity with the bigger society.\nHistory has witnessed many disasters that befell minorities due to their disputes with the majorities. We are not going to give a historical survey of the massacres of minorities that the world witnessed at the turn of the twentieth century in Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nBut in the modern age, an important development took place in the world. The system of human rights has become the grounds for the existence of a minority among the majority particularly in the West, which fostered the principles of human rights, which was basically established as a means of coexistence between the followers of Protestant and Catholic Churches. But in the course of time, minorities from Africa and Asia have been allowed to live there. These minorities emerged for different reasons that had led to the migration of the workers from colonies to the colonizing countries.\nFor a period of history the Islamic civilization was the only human civilization which regulates the rights of minorities with regard to the practice of their religious rites and their right to resort to their own courts.\nThus the Coptic minority has lived for 14 centuries protected by Islam, as was the case with the Jewish minority in Morocco.\nAfter World War I, many of the international treaties were concerned with the protection of minorities. The issue of minorities was one of the most important problems that faced the League of Nations.\nThe situation of Muslim minorities in non-Muslim countries can be described as one of necessity in the general sense of the word which includes need and necessity in its particular sense.\nTherefore, it needs a special kind of fiqh. This does not mean the formation of a new fiqh outside of the framework of the Islamic fiqh whose basic references are the Quran and the Sunnah together with other evidences such as ijma` (consensus), qiyas (analogical reasoning), juristic preference, public unrestricted interests, blocking the means to evil, custom and presumption of continuity, in addition to all other evidences approved by scholars when they expressed their different juristic opinions, which represent a rich and broad legacy. Thus the issues of minorities are old in genre but new in type.\nThe growing Islamic existence poses new challenges and tasks, and endowments could be a means to deal with this complex situation if the Islamic endowment is established in different fields besides mosques, or houses of worship as they are called in the West, and educational institutions, which are of major importance in all the levels of educations including elementary and secondary levels where the individual’s creedal and ethical personality is formed, in addition to providing a solution for the problem of banning hijab in some European countries. This is also the case with regard to higher and university education, such as the institute of Human Sciences in Paris, which students from Europe attend, and cultural centres where cultural activities can take place to preserve Muslims’ cultural and intellectual distinctiveness and to play a role that integrates with the role of the educational institutes and mosques. There are also some other important fields that Muslims have not paid attention to such as study and research centres. The European Council for Fatwa and Research has a research branch that issues the Council magazine. We need endowments in the field of research, thoughts, social studies, dialogue, etc.\nSimilarly, Muslim minorities need active economic and cultural institutions to compensate for their weakness, safeguard their creed, and preserve their children through teaching them their religion, and help the needy, the poor, and the sick among them; particularly after the number of Muslims in the West has increased and their existence there has become no longer accidental but rather perpetual and growing. According to some researchers, their number has exceeded 60 million in America and Europe including both native Muslims in Eastern Europe and newcomers. There are cities where the number of Muslims tends to grow faster than the number of the people of other religions as in the case of Brussels in Belgium, capital of Europe. In Paris, the number of Muslims has reached two million.\nEndowment in Western Countries\nSecond: the obstacles of Islamic endowment in the West\nEndowment in the West faces obstacles:\nThe first obstacle is the scarcity of resources, which resulted mainly from the fierce attack against charity institutions, which has driven many of charity doers to abstain from giving money that helps in establishing endowments in the West. Hence, they spend instead – when they do spend – on building mosques and orphanages within a very limited geographical area, while missionary institutions spend lavishly to establish their call in Muslim countries in Africa and Asia without restriction.\nTherefore, this subject should be added to the list of dialogue with the West and the attention of officials should be drawn to the importance of equal treatment in such issues.\nMuslims are like one body. We cannot let down Muslim minorities that constitute a part of the Muslim nation, a bridge for cultural communication, and a link in the chain of the relation with the West.\nThe second obstacle is that there are some flaws in achieving solidarity and cooperation between individuals and Islamic associations in West countries. This constitutes an obstacle before making collective efforts to establish challenging multi-purpose endowment institutions. However, there is an undeniable level of solidarity – thanks to Allah – in more than one district.\nThe third obstacle is the lack of organisational and administrative competency to achieve the maximum utilisation of the available – or potentially available – human and financial resources.\nThe fourth obstacle is working in conformity with the Western systems and laws. Muslim minorities live in a non-Muslim society under positive laws which mostly differ from the rulings of the Shari`ah that regulates the Islamic endowment owing to its special nature that requires rules that cannot be harmonised with the Western systems even with the employment of ijtihad and selection of juristic opinions.\nSolutions:\nTo face these obstacles we can suggest, with regard to the first obstacle, that significant endowment organisations in the Islamic world can grant large funds to acknowledged Islamic institutions in these countries to carry out an endowment program resisted.\nI confess that this solution requires intense communication between the beneficiary Islamic organizations and the officials, particularly after some organisations in European countries have started to set up local funding institutions to build and supervise houses of worship as protective measures against what is called “incoming fundamentalism.”\nWith regard to the second obstacle, there is a need for more awareness in the ranks of Muslims in order to convince them to integrate their organizations, as in the meantime institutions and mosques are established on ethnical or sometimes doctrinal basis. This then will help in forming huge endowments to meet the need. In this context rose the new European Islamic endowment and a similar one in America which supervises over 130 mosques. The European Council for Fatwa and Research and the International Union of Muslim Scholars can play a leading role in this field.\nAs for the third obstacle, which is related to lacking the organisational and administrative competency for ideal utilisation, it can be overcome, in my view, through exchanging experiences, organising courses, and focusing on successful examples to be raised as models. The General Secretary of Endowments in Kuwait can supervise these courses.\nWith regard to the fourth obstacle, which is related to fiqh and legal sides, we have to point it out to clarify in brief the nature of endowment in Islam.\nThe definition of waqf (endowment):\nIn Arabic, the words waqf and habs (dedication) are used synonymously by jurists for the same meaning, though al-Rassa` held the view that waqf is a stronger term than tahbees. [SeeSharh al-Rassa` 2:539]\nThis word can be used for the endowed thing and for the act of endowing itself.\nIbn `Arafah defined it as endowing the utility of something as long as it exists while remaining in the possession of its endower even assumingly.\nIbn `Arafah rejected the definition given by Ibn `Abd al-Salam who defined it as “endowing utilities forever”, for it does not apply to all cases.\nThe author of Aqrab al-Masalik defined it as dedicating the utility or product of a property, even for a payment, for someone for a period determined by the granter. [Al-Sharh al-Sagheer li al-Dardeer 4:97]\nAccording to Abu Hanifah, it is to dedicate a property in accordance with the will of the granter of the utility in charity. [See the commentary of Ibn `Abdeen 3:357]\nIbn Qudamah said: it means to dedicate the estate and give the product in charity. [al-Mughny8:184]\nThis definition is close to the exact wording of the hadith reported by al-Nasa’y in his Sunan on the authority of Ibn `Umar that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to `Umar about the share he was given from Khaybr “Dedicate the estate and give the product in charity.” [Reported by al-Daraqutny and al-Bayhaqy and authenticated by al-Albany in Irwa’ al-ghaleel]\nEndowment is a great institution that manifests the wisdom of this divine and eternal shari`ah with regard to establishing the bases of cooperation between the individuals of the community and taking care of the people of need and poverty even before they come to existence. It is a credit for the coming generations and a running charity of a running reward for the endowers to receive the return in their graves and on the day of resurrection.\nTherefore, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) listed it among the three deeds of constant rewards that do not cease with death. The authentic hadith reads “When a human being dies, all his deeds come to end with the exception of three: a running charity, beneficial knowledge, or a pious child who prays for him.” [Reported by Muslim]\nThe running charity was interpreted as the endowment. Al-Shafi`y (may Allah be pleased with him) said that endowment is one of the peculiarities of this nation and was not known before Islam.\nOne of the characteristics of endowment is the perpetuity of the estate while spending the product on charity avenues. Therefore, there are many rulings related to endowments which form one complete system that acts as a shield to block the ways to intervene with the endowment in the face of the governors and administrators who may attempt to change or even waste it.\nHence, issues such as exchanging, substituting, transferring, compensating, restoring, and dividing the endowment have all gained the interest of Muslim jurists and sometimes led to juristic differences. This gave rise to three juristic schools that have different points of view: one school is conservative with regard to the estate of the endowment to the extent of strict abiding by words; another one manages the estate freely to preserve the perpetuity of the utility not the perpetuity of the estate; and third one takes a middle course between the two sides and inclines to the preponderant benefit in a rigid flexibility – if it is possible to combine between two opposites.\nThe first group includes the Malikites and the Shafi`ites. They do not allow exchanging or compensation in endowments except to very narrow limits in certain cases, which we will mention later.\nThe second group is represented by the Hanbilites and some Malikite scholars; particularly the Andalusians.\nThe third group which goes with the preponderant interests consists of some Hanifite scholars, such as Abu Yousof, and late Hanbilite scholars such as Ibn Taymiyyah, in addition to some late Malikite scholars.\nHere we adopt the opinion of the school that goes with the interest with regard to endowment and thus allows transferring it and compensating for it. This school adopts the Malikite definition of endowment we quoted from Aqrab al-Masalik because the endowed property does not have to be immoveable. It should be just a property or even a utility during the period of lease. Also, this school does not disallow timing in endowment.\nOne important issue related to endowment is its administration. Revising scholars’ opinions and the positions of the schools of Islamic law, the administration is for the endower, the appointed administrator, the judge, the Muslim ruler, the beneficiaries, and Muslim community. (See our book I`mal al-Maslahah fi al-Waqf and the paper we presented to this forum about the administration of endowment)\nThe administrator could be one or more persons as explicitly stated by the author of al-Tawdeeh al-Jami` bayna al-Muqni` wa al-Tanqeeh who belongs to the Hanbalite school.\nTherefore, the association administers the endowment and so does the foundation in the new French system in which a government commissioner joins.\nThe permissibility of dedicating an endowment to non-Muslims relies on the case when Safiyyah, mother of the believers, (may Allah be pleased with her) dedicated an endowment fund to her Jewish brother.\nIt is also permissible to dedicate an endowment fund for a church to spend on those who pass by it (see al-Mughny and other references). This is of course when the endowment functions as a social institution from which both Muslims and non-Muslims benefit. So is the case when the endowment is an educational institution that receives Muslim and non-Muslim children; because the interest of Muslims is the most important criterion in this regard.\nAs for the case in the West, there are various forms: to register an association for public utility that has legal personality. This association administers the properties according to the institutional system to which it submitted in order to get the license. It can raise funds from the public and can also receive aid from authorities as well as grants and wills.\nThere is the form of foundation which does not differ much from the system of the associations of public utility with regard to their resources. But there is one big difference in the French law which is that the grants given to the foundation needs an administrative license to receive donations.\nMoreover, the acknowledgement of the foundation needs a decree from the State Council which is the highest judicial body in France.\nIn conclusion:\nThere must be a comprehensive outlook to the status quo of endowments in the West and the future horizons to find a suitable form that allows the promotion of endowments in the Western circles while sticking at the same time to the basic principles of endowments in the Islamic shari`ah.\nFinally, there are many fields of Islamic endowment in the West; the most important of which are: the field of calling to the way of Allah; the educational field; the social field; and the field of scientific researches, as elaborately explained by Dr. `Abd al-Majeed al-Najjar in his paper “Maqasid al-Waqf fi al-Gharb“.\nIt is probably right to make a list of Muslims’ needs in these fields.\nAllah is the One who grants success.\nAbdullah ibn al-Sheikh Mahfudh ibn Bayyah\nJeddah 23 Rabi` al-Awwal 1426 AH.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

Most scholars judged it to be impermissible, citing a Prophetic hadith that prohibits it, while some others permitted it. To be in the safe side, use non-string and non-wind instruments, such as drums, tambourine, and other percussion instruments.\nOnce, I met the chanter Sami Yusuf in Canada, where he made several performances. I cannot disapprove of his use of music in chants. Unless there are evident considerations that entail prohibition, no decisive judgment should be given on such controversial issues as the use of music.

      "Question": "Using Zakah in Building Institutes of Al-Azhar",
      "Answer": "\nIs it permissible to spend Zakah money to build Azhari institutes? Bear in mind that students in our country are in a dire need of this type of education, which is not financially supported by the state. Please answer us, may Allah reward you!\nScholars differ as to this point. Some believe that the category of “for Allah’s Cause” – mentioned in the Qur’an as one of the eight categories on which Zakah may be spent – may cover building Azhari institutes. It also covers paying for tuition, paving roads and building hospitals. All of these things are “for Allah’s Cause”, as they believe. Yet, the majority of scholars believe that the category of “for Allah’s Cause” covers only those going to Jihad or to Hajj. So there are two groups of scholars. One group thinks that the category of “for Allah’s Cause” may include any act done for Allah’s Sake. This opinion is held by the Shafi`i Imam Al-Qaffal and Sheikh Muhammad Abdu and his student Muhammad Rashid Rida, in addition to some contemporary scholars. Thus, it is permissible to build Azhari institutes from Zakah money, according to their view. However, the widely known opinion is that of the majority of scholar which prefers giving Zakah to the poor or fighters in the cause of Allah, or according to Malik, to buy weapons. Scholars of this opinion further believe that this category does not include such things in question. So, Azhari institutes should be built with money from charity or endowments. And Allah knows best.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Visiting Suspicious People",
      "Answer": "\nPeace be upon you! I am a married woman and I have been pregnant twice but I lost my pregnancy for no apparent reason both times. A sister offered taking me to a lady who has a long experience in women’s health issues. She said she is able to diagnose the disease just by putting her hand on a woman’s stomach! I went to the woman but I was surprised to find her asking about my name and my mother’s name. I got up and pretended I had to leave urgently but she asked me again to leave my name and my mother’s so that she could pray Istikharah and discover what is wrong with me. I refused and did not go there again. My question is: Could this woman be a charlatan? If she is one, is it permissible to warn other women from going to her? Finally, I want you to guide me to someone in Makkah who treats diseases according to Shari`ah, with the help of the Qur’an and also herbs.\nI am not sure if this woman is a charlatan or not but I advise you to visit doctors and pray to Allah frequently, asking for forgiveness.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Unified Adhan",
      "Answer": "\nPeace be upon you. In our mosque, we announce the Adhan according to the Sunnah. We do not follow the unified Adhan system and we have been doing this for a long time now. Some people object to this and call for the adoption of the unified Adhan system which depends on the use of the radio. What is your opinion about this? Do we comply or do we keep following the Sunnah and the righteous predecessors? Does the ruling on the unified Adhan fall under what is called Fiqh Al-Waqi` (Jurisprudence of Contemporary Reality)?\n You should follow the practice of the Sunnah. Each mosque announces the Adhan by itself. Do not air the Adhan from the radio, for this is not supported by any evidence. Thus, you have to follow the Sunnah and announce the Adhan yourselves, as this act cannot be done by proxy. The unified Adhan system does not fall under any category of Fiqh. There is no need for it, since the basic ruling is that every mosque announces the Adhan, following the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Scholars agree unanimously on this, without any exceptions.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Unified Concept of Freedom for Humanity",
      "Answer": "\nIn this article, we will continue to discuss the limits of freedom of expression, philosophy of freedom, and impact of freedom on promoting or undermining inter-civilization dialogue, which was partly referred to in our discussion of the notion of a universal system of freedoms for all humanity.\nGenerally speaking, freedom cannot be absolute, or otherwise it would lead to chaos in every way. So, there is a need for what is called “public order”, which serves as (1) a tool to regulate freedoms, (2) a criterion for capacity of intervention by official authorities, and (3) a means of control by the regulatory body.\nPublic order varies depending on the culture, interests, and morality of each nation. Naturally, public order in Islam is quite different from that in the Western civilization.\nTo illustrate, let’s take an example: In 1996, UK authorities refused to grant distribution certificate in respect of a video work that was considered contemptuous of Christ, which would outrage the feelings of Christians and disturb public order. The producer of the video recording lodged an application with the European Court of Human Rights, alleging a violation of his right to freedom of expression. On 25 November, 1996, the Court pronounced its judgment on the case (widely known as “Wingrove v. the United Kingdom”), upholding the restriction on the film because it was found blasphemous.\nOn the other hand, the Court upheld the ban by Turkish authorities of the Refah (Welfare) Party, stating in the preamble that the party adopted Islamic Shari`ah, which was incompatible with the European value system — or, let’s say, “the Western public order”.\nHere, we have two cases: In one case, the Court respected the Western value system, in which Christ is regarded as sacred; so, restriction of freedom of expression was a legitimate measure against whatever abuses such sacredness, in view of the principle of public order. But in the other case, Islamic Shari`ah was not regarded as sacred under the same Western values; so, freedom of expression should be restricted for its advocates.\nThe same discrimination was stark in the response of many public figures in the West to the notorious cartoons mocking Prophet Muhammad.\nThat is the logic of Western public order. It is not our concern here to debate with Westerners or prove their paradoxical position resulting from intolerance and a sense of superiority. We take their position as consistent with their personal views and convictions. But they should respect others, and if they exercise their right to act upon their public order, they should at least recognize others’ right to exercise the same principle and ultimately recognize relativity in public order. Each nation has its own public order and value system.\nAs Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights stipulates restricting the freedoms set forth in the Declaration when in conflict with public order, which differs from one environment or culture to another, this can be considered an implicit recognition of the impact of cultural diversity on human rights.\nThere are differences in family laws, transactions, criminalization of certain acts etc., based on the differences in values.\nRecognizing differences makes factions feel the significance and meaningfulness of dialogue and shows that it is not a matter of overpowering others by denying them their natural right to be different and requiring them to identify with you as a prerequisite for communication and interaction.\nThe key to successful communication is to accept one another as is, not as wished.\nIn the end of this discussion, I cite a Western philosopher who best depicted the relativity and environment-dependent nature of values. In his work Adventures of Ideas, Whitehead wrote, “The details of these moral codes are relative to the social circumstances of the immediate environment — life at a certain date on ‘the fertile fringe of the Arabian Desert, on the lower slopes of the Himalayan Mountains, on the plains of China, on the plains of India, or on the delta of some great river.\nAgain, the meaning of the critical terms is shifting and ambiguous — for example, the notions of ownership, family, marriage, murder, God. Conduct that in one environment and at one stage produces its measures of harmonious satisfaction, in other surroundings at another stage is destructively degrading. Each society has its own type of perfection, and puts up with certain blots, at that stage inevitable.\nThus, the notion that there are certain regulative notions, sufficiently precise to prescribe details of conduct, for all reasonable beings on Earth, in every planet, and in every star-system, is at once to be put aside. That is the notion of the one type of perfection at which the universe aims” (Whitehead, Adventures of Ideas, translated by Anis Hassan Zaki, p. 439).\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Answer": "\nHis Eminence Sheikh Abdullah Bin Bayyah, the Vice-President of the International Union of Muslim Scholars (“IUMS”) and the President of the Arab Islamic Dialogue Committee, stressed the need to introduce convincing values, especially to the Muslim youth in Europe. Such values would permanently deter them from committing the follies of terrorism or crime, and invite them to present the values of Islam and tolerance to Europeans.\nSheikh Bin Bayyah called on concerned bodies in the West to grant Muslim communities their rights, particularly their cultural rights, provided such characteristics do not contradict with the European Community’s basic principles.  He also called on Westerners to reconsider the relationship with the Muslim world to found a more auspicious coexistence for all, on the basis of common values of morality, intelligence and generosity.\nThe Vice-President of the IUMS said: “The world’s charity institutions have become a positive partner committed to support the projects of overall human development. They contribute to the advancement of Muslim societies by strengthening their public facilities, developing their physical, technical, and productive institutions as well as through the scholarships, educational institutions, training centers and the provision of relief assistance in emergencies or disasters. These charity institutions have been able to open up wider prospects for the global charity work in Asia and Africa, and have extended bridges of cooperation and assistance with all Islamic peoples.”\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Answer": "\nDear sheikh, why fasting was made obligatory upon Muslims? What is the wisdom behind the obligation of fasting? We want to make benefit from your knowledge sheikh.\nAlmighty Allah said “O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you as it has been prescribed for those before you, so that you may be God-fearing.” Being God-fearing is achieved through compliance to the commands of Allah and avoidance of His forbiddances inwardly and outwardly. Fasting is one of the catalysts and manifestations of God-fearing. It is a manifestation of submission to the commands of Almighty Allah and being patience with His commands and with fulfilling His injunctions upon His servants. There are many other benefits on both worldly and hereafter sides, such as being in a state similar to that of the angels and giving up sensual and bodily wants so that one can draw closer to the heavenly world and thus soars to the level of excellence in doing good. Excellence in doing good is to worship Allah as though you see Him. During fasting you refrain from food, drink, whims and desires, which uplifts your spirituality to the level of worshiping Allah as though you see Him. Fasting is one of the Islamic mainstays and obligations prescribed by Almighty Allah to show total submission for Him. One thus follows what was sent down to Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). Fasting has so many benefits and virtues in this world and in the hereafter.

Everything should be done to stop this terrible, ongoing massacre in Gaza.”\nThe prominent Sheikh added that all that scholars can do is “call upon our rulers to help Gaza, especially as there are no borders open to Gaza for the Arab peoples to extend help. We appeal to them (the Arab leaders) to exert the utmost effort in rescuing such innocent souls and stop this unjust bloodshed.”\nIn the same respect, Bin Bayyah sent a special message to Palestinians: “I also call upon our Palestinian brothers to unite all resistance movements into one entity. They should by no means remain so divided anymore. They have to join hands in the same name and under the same banner. And it is the duty of all Arabs to help them in the name of Islam, logic, pan-Arabism and humanity.”\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "The Purpose of Communication with Non-Muslims",
      "Answer": "\nWe spoke in a previous article, and we will continue to consider in subsequent articles, about the difficulties in communication between the Islamic and other civilizations. In this article we wonder: What is the purpose of communication?\nThe purpose of this particular form of communication is to search for points of convergence through logic, reason and understanding. It looks to reach a common ground, based on mutual interests, that reveals the falsity of bigotry deposits that distort the image of Islam and Muslims. The other purpose is acculturation and intellectual cross-fertilization, which creates a mutual effect. This replaces the haughtiness and superiority, exuded by a large sector of leaders of free thought in the West, with that of tolerance. Their approach can be summarized in the exclusion of the other, as explained by the French writer Sophie Bessis in her book TheWest and Others.\nThus, our purpose is also to alleviate the extremism of those calling for a clash of civilizations. We hope to remove the prevailing image of a Muslim sector that considers the entire West ‘a devil’ whose friendship is impossible and all his notions refutable, even if they might be useful to humanity.\nAs a result of the West’s outward perception of haughtiness, western civilization endeavors to impose its vision on others, failing to recognize the right of diversity and difference. Whoever does not accept such a vision is considered to belong to the camp of ‘evil’, because the world is so simply divided into those two camps; good and evil. This is the basis on which the idea of clash of civilizations is founded. Such an idea considers Islam to be the only civilization which still resists western containment and modernity, as stated by Fukuyama who resembles Samuel Huntington’s opinion in this regard.\nThe suggestion of the ‘inevitability’ of a clash of civilizations as a result of diversity is merely proof of the failure by one of the two civilizations to recognize this right of diversity. Such a right would be the basis for dialogue and a means to know one another. Thus, the concept of communication proceeds to face the concept of a clash. Some western bodies have invented what they called “critical dialogue” with some countries.\nThe ultimate goal of dialogue and communication is to create a breach in the wall of this extremist visualization. Without this breach, such extremes will only breed further radicalism and clashes. As the saying goes: “he who sows the wind reaps the whirlwind.” The clearest example of this contrast is the attitude of many intellectuals in the West regarding the cartoons aimed to harm the image of our master, the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). If they do not support the abuse openly, they resent the reaction of the Muslim world and consider what the newspaper has done to be normal or freedom of expression. The violent behavior, however, of some Muslims in reaction to this incident does not serve the cause of communication.\nThe process of communication will try to overcome the cultural and psychological barrier by extending bridges between civilizations to make alternatives available, instead of the perpetual and sterile conflict. What are the next steps? These five steps will be considered in another article.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "The General Regulations of Acting upon Licenses",
      "Answer": "\nI want the sheikh to talk even briefly about licenses and their regulations. We see on the internet strange kinds of licenses. Some people allow performing the Prayer before its due time and some people go with the time of Mecca with regard to breaking fasting. We need guidelines for these people even if some of them have excuses. For example, in some districts here in France `Isha Prayer comes late at some months and hence some people give fatwa that only one hour should be observed [after Maghrib] and then one may perform it. But I wonder how could we observe the original timing in other Prayers and disregard it with regard to `Isha Prayer? Moreover, some people allow following the timing of Mecca with regard to breaking the fast on days of long daytime as in Norway and the like countries. We need a brief word about the general regulations of acting upon licenses. We studied this issue, but we need the sheikh to shed more light.\n I would like to say that license stands for a ruling changed to another easier one due to some excuse in spite of the existence of the original effective cause. We have to take all these details into consideration. If the original effective cause is no longer existent, this cannot be called license. Accordingly, breaking one’s fasting while traveling is a license because the original effective ruling, which is the obligation of fasting, is still existent and therefore if he fasts, his fasting will be valid. This is license which is regulated by a set of regulations. None can leave out the original ruling unless the reasons of the license are ascertained. The original ruling is the basic universal principle as al-Shatibit said. This universal principle cannot be broken if one is in doubt about the license. Only if the reason of the license is ascertained, one can move to the license. With regard to the issues the questioner asked about, those who break their fasting according to the timing of Mecca actually do not have license to do that. They have to observe fasting during their daytime and break it when the sun sets. He also mentioned the issue of the long day which causes big problem these days. As long as there is day and night, there is no text from the lawgiver that indicates the validity of not observing fasting in this case. But if one finds during the day that he suffers hardship, he may break his fasting in that day to make it up later just as the case with the hardship of traveling and of sickness; this is the opinion of the Hanifites who said that severe hunger and hardship allow breaking fasting. The Malikites also a similar fatwa to shepards and to those who dig wells. Thus the ruling of this case should be ascertained. I hope that they understand this. The sign is the day and the night. They have to fast during daytime; but if someone finds hardship, such as workers in factories and trains and the like cases, such a person can break his fast during the day if he suffers hardship that makes him too weak to work. Thus breaking the fast in this case is based on this hardship not on the difference of timings or the length of the day, for fasting is obligatory during daytime.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "The Imam Spending the Mosque’s Money",
      "Answer": "\nThe worshippers in a certain mosque collected a sum of money to be used in offering food to fasting Muslims in Ramadan and whatever remained could be used to for anything the mosque needed. Is it permissible for the Imam of the mosque to spend this sum on building some rooms without the knowledge of the people in the mosque? When he was asked about the money, he said he had to spend it somewhere and will return it some day\nThe basic ruling is that the Imam has no right to spend the money allocated to offer food to fasting worshippers elsewhere. He should not spend the money on anything else other than offering food to fasting people. If there is an amount left over after offering food to all the fasting people, and so there is no fasting person left to feed, and if the Imam is given permission by the people who gave the money to spend it as he sees best, then he can spend it on something else. But if the Imam is entrusted with the money only to feed fasting people, he has absolutely no right to spend the money on something else. If he is given permission to spend the remaining money as he sees best after feeding all fasting people and no fasting person remains, he can spend the remaining amount to answer the needs of the mosque. Ibn Sahl Al-Maliki believes that it is permissible to spend the money collected in the mosque to benefit the mosque itself, although the matter is subject to difference among scholars. Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taimiyah has a similar opinion regarding Waqf; he believes it can be spent on the Waqf establishment itself, as long as there is an urgent need. Based on this, if the Imam is commissioned by those who gave the money and there is no fasting person who needs to be feed, and spending the money on a certain channel benefits the mosque, then it is permissible to do it.

      "Question": "The Means to Deviation",
      "Answer": "\nThe erudite scholar Abdullah Ibn Bayyah, vice chairman of the International Union of Muslim Scholars, pointed out the characteristics of terrorists and summarised them in three points. He mentioned that they have characteristics that are condemned and rejected by the shari`ah. These are extravagance, extremism, and adoption of strict positions. Ibn Bayyah said that Islam has forbidden extremism in religion; namely, to go to extremity. He quoted the hadith reported by Ibn `Abbas that he (peace and blessings be upon him) said “Beware of extremism in religion. Extremism in religion brought destruction to those who were before you.”\nHe also forbad extravagance which, just like extremism, is to exceed the limits in words or deeds. In the hadith reported by Ibn Mas`oud we read “Perished be the extravagant!” He said it three times. These three terms denote being away from moderation in thought and speech. This goes contrary to the methodology of moderation and leads to fanaticism and bigotry which are synonymous with extremism and fundamentalism.\nThree sides:\nIbn Bayyah discussed the three sides that are directly responsible for the prevention from and the cure of such deviant thought. These are the family, the educational institutions, and the media. He said that the family is the first environment that affects the behavior of young people. Thus it has a significance role in good upbringing which saves children from intellectual and behavioural deviation. Intellectual conceptions are known to move one’s will which soon turns to be practical behavior translating the thought into practice.\nHe added: Family has a gear responsibility to amend the defect and fill the intellectual gap which the youth suffer from in the age of globalization and flow of exciting thoughts that exhaust the soul, display crimes, and magnify murder and fighting. Ibn Bayyah laid emphasis on the role of the family and said that every family has to teach its children how to distinguish truth from falsehood and darkness from light.\nFamily plays a significant role in the prevention and cure. When a child is seen to have a feeling of aversion to the society and isolation from the community, the family has to set him on the right path seeking the help of specialists to treat him before it is too late and before he is lost in the corridors of darkness.\nIbn Bayyah talked about the role of the educational institutions and said: They have an effective role in crystallising the conceptions that form the wills of individuals and groups. The more positive, effective and pioneering these institutions are, the more they become able to bring up a generation of leaders and positive and rational individuals; and their students will entertain more intellectual and psychological immunity.\nOne the other side, the more the educational process fails and the deficiency in presenting the correct ideas and information is, the more loss and failure the graduates will suffer, which will make them more susceptible to deviant ideas and to get involved in the criminal endeavors and futile practices. He said that the educational system from the elementary to the university level, including technical institutions, is responsible for a task that can be described as the task of communicating with the psychological and emotional realm of the student.\nIbn Bayyah talked about the third side defining it as written, audible, or visible national journalism. This side is concerned with daily treatment of events to present, comment on, explain, and direct them. He described its role as decisive, because news has become like daily food for people. He said: But the situation of the national journalism has become very difficult due to the torrential flow of information that includes good and evil, truth and falsehood.  He described this as a mixture that makes the recipient live in a whirlwind of frustration and sometimes of fallacies. But the intelligence of a journalist together with his sincerity to his religion and nation and his abilities and talents enable him to deal with his audience and to ensure success in the ruthless media competition.\nBriefly, these three sides, in addition to the role of mosques and intellectual and cultural meetings in social clubs, can form a harmonious system with multiple tools and techniques that have one goal and end to convey the proper message and correct concepts to the youth in order to rectify their behaviour and set aright their inclination and to guide those who went astray to the right way. This is the gain we should aim at in order that the whole ummah should benefit and the youth should succeed.\nIbn Bayyah concluded his speech saying: There are two authorities in this regard. The first is fiqh academies and fatwa institutions that have to refute deviant thoughts and extreme trends and rebut false fatwas and the sophistry of muftis. The second is the authorities whose role in this issue does not differ from their role in all criminal issues as their task is to protect the society from crime and criminals through searching for criminals and collecting evidences to brought criminals to justice.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "The Destiny of Those Who Have Not Hear about Islam",
      "Answer": "\nI have a question that may seem queer but it haunts me often. Islam is the religion of the Lord of all the worlds. The Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) is the Messenger for all the worlds. But has Islam reached all the people of the earth in a perfect and proper way? Islam has not reached many of the people of in the world in a proper way. They do not know it or they know it in a distorted way that may drive them away from even reading or searching about it; besides, there is no honest translation about Islam in any language. How will Allah hold them accountable for something they knew nothing about? Also, do the people of the Scripture know that they are wrong and that Islam is the religion of Allah? I see many of them believing that they are right. Some persons say to me that they have to search for the truth. But I wonder, if any of us hears about a new religion propagated by someone, would we go and examine it? Or would we avoid conducting any research because we believe that we are right? Similarly, they believe that they are right; so why should they conduct such a research? Is this a trial that Almighty Allah put the people of the Scripture to and relieved it from those who have been born as Muslims in Muslim families without any hardship?\nAll praise is due to Allah. Peace and blessing be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon all his family and his companions. It seems that the question can be reduced to: Has Islam reached all the people? The answer is that Islam has not reached all the people, but it may reach all of them in time because in one hadith we read, “The Hour of doom will not come until there is no house – be it a tent or a building – but this religion will enter it with might  or with humility.” [Reported by Ahmad (16957) al-Bayhaqy in his Sunan (9:181), al-Tabarany in al-Kabeer (1280)] Hence, the religion will spread. Media channels and globalization that has turned the earth into one village have provided tools to allow Islam to enter every house. Muslims have to make committed efforts to convey Islam to others. As for whether this has taken place or not, it may have not taken place yet. Those who are punishable by fire are those whom the religion has reached but they did not believe in it. Almighty Allah said, “Say: ‘This Quran has been revealed to me [as a means] with which to forewarn you and whomever it reaches.’ ” [6:19]; that is, to forewarn you and all those whom it reaches, even if they have not seen me or talked to me. Thus, whoever the Quran has reached has been forewarned by it. Hence, we have to convey it to all the people. When the Quran reaches them, the proof against them becomes established. On the other hand, the proof is not established against those whom the Quran has not reached. Their case is rather like the case of the people who lived in the interval between the prophets, such as those who lived before the prophetic mission. Almighty Allah said, “Never do We torment [any nation] until We send forth a messenger [with heavenly guidance],” [17:15] and also said, “Whenever any throng [of non-muslims] is cast into it [the fire], its keepers say to them: Did there not come to you a forewarner? They will say: Oh yes! There did, indeed, come to us a forewarner.” [67:8-9] Almighty Allah has sent the messengers so that people would have no proof against Allah. The proof becomes established, complete and overwhelming – “Say: Yet to Allah belongs the all-conclusive proof,” [6:149] – when the message reaches a person and he does not believe in it out of bigotry, turning away from it, hating it, or disbelieving and denying it. Almighty Allah said, “Thus, even though, within their souls, they were certain of them (the signs), they disavowed them, wrongfully and haughtily.” [27:14] They do not want to see the truth, “They enfold [unbelief within] their breast.” [11:5] Many of the non-Muslims these days may be in this situation. Perhaps some of them have seen the truth and the facts have become clear for him, but they stick to their habits and love the power they have, or their hatred towards Muslims drives them to be fanatic and turns them blind, and thus they turn away from reflecting on the Book of Allah. Such turning away from reflection, in spite of it being possible, and turning away from the message, in spite of the ability to know it, make the person punishable, “Indeed, the [true] religion with Allah is Islam” [3:19] “And so, anyone who seeks a religion other than Islam, never shall it be accepted from him.” [3:85] In this world we live together and, “none should be forced to embrace any religion ……..” [2:256] This is our position and this show we call people in other countries to Islam. This does not mean that the truth is many. The truth is one. It is this religion which is the last religion and the one that has dominance over all other religions. This, in short, is the answer of this question.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Answer": "\nWe mentioned in the previous article that the process of communication tries to overcome psychological and cultural barriers to extend bridges between civilizations. It looks to provide alternatives for the perpetual and sterile conflict that we find ourselves in. We pointed out that achieving this requires five steps. We will mention some of these steps in this episode of articles dedicated to the treatment of the problem of communication between Islamic civilization and other civilizations. So, what are some of these steps? We summarize some of them below.\nThe first step is to convince the parties who hope to communicate, or who are still hesitant, that there is no substitute for dialogue. Both parties must be persuaded that wars and mutual hatred can be replaced by peace and harmony. Wise men must behave accordingly by replacing enmity with channels of communication. When consciences recover from tyranny and souls recover from vanity there is an opportunity to take advantage of globalization by exchanging the manufactured with natural products, as well as intellectual, literature, legal and philosophical products. In this era of shrinking distances and globalization of communication, transportation and technology, none will win through war or the process of instability and threat. The victorious party will also lose. The awareness of this fact will be the first step to dialogue.\nThe second step concerns goals and objectives. The linking of communication and dialogue with goals and objectives will organize the process and steer the path to communication; even though the path may appear crooked. On the contrary, the idle and undetermined dialogue, which has no goal or purpose, is just dialogue for dialogue’s sake. It might be acceptable at the beginning of the road to explore arenas of communication and clarify aspects of its problems. But it should not be permanent, rather, the interlocutors must seek certain stations to reach, which attract and push them to reach their goals, thereby making difficulties easy and enabling  them to overcome obstacles. Therefore, this regulation is central in the process of communication and exchange that prevails in the global arena.\nThe third step is the recognition of diversity to reach mutual understanding and achieve harmony. Such recognition is the most important factor for dispute resolution. Thus, it may be convenient to refer to some differences in morals, such as the difference of origin or differing concepts of public order, the latter of which is a custom that determines good and bad conduct in any society.\nDue to the importance of the Public Order Theory in the disputable intellectual cases and its consequent results, we will explain this briefly on the next occasion, in addition to the remainder of the steps.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "The Categories of the Excused People in Fasting",
      "Answer": "\nOur honorable sheikh! We talk about people who have excuses and are allowed to break their fast. What are the categories of inability that allow Muslim to break his fast?\nAll praise is due to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds. May Allah send peace and blessings upon our master Muhammad and upon his family and his companions. The shari`ah intends ease and does not intend to make things difficult or cause ruin to people. This is one of the characteristics of this gracious shari`ah. Almighty Allah said “[These are] the ones who shall follow the Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, whom they find inscribed in the Torah [that is] with them and in the Evangel; who enjoins them with what is right and forbids them from what is wrong, making lawful for them wholesome things, and prohibiting for them impure things; and relieving them from the burden [of strict obligation] and the yokes that were [laid] upon them.” This is a complementary statement to your introduction. Accordingly, we say that people of excuses include travelers and sick people as explicitly stated in the Quran “But one among you who is sick or is on a journey [shall fast] the same number of other days.” The sick person is excusable, and fasting is not obligatory upon him. He is not even permitted to fast if he is badly sick. But scholars differed in the degree of the disease that allows breaking fasting. All the scholars agree that severe sickness drops the obligation of fasting if it causes such harm that may lead- or almost lead- to perishing, which is the case of maximum necessity. There is also a slight sickness that does not remit the obligation of fasting except according to the view of a group of scholars such as al-Bukhary who held the view that the word “sick” covers every person who feels sick and so he dropped the obligation of fasting in the case of slight sickness. This position finds support in reports attributed to some scholars from among the Successors. But scholars differed concerning mild sickness. The correct position is that if fasting will lead to prolonging or increasing the sickness, the obligation of fasting becomes remitted in the sense that one is permitted to give up fasting but he does not have to. This means that if he fasts, his fasting will be valid, according to the correct scholarly position, because sickness remits the immediate obligation not the reason of the obligation. This is the difference between sickness, on the one hand, and menstruation and postnatal bleeding, on the other hand. In case of menstruation and postnatal bleeding a woman is not permitted to fast. These are two other excuses considered by the lawgiver and fasting in these cases is not even valid or permissible, whereas if the sick person can endure fasting, his fasting will be valid according to the position of the majority. Traveling also remits the obligation of fasting.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "The Concept of Jihad",
      "Answer": "\nThis beautiful word “jihad” has been subject to extreme points of view at both ends.\nWhat does the concept of jihad literally and technically mean and what are its reasons in the Noble Quran?\nThe word Jihad is an infinitive of the verb jahada. It means to do one’s utmost and exert one’s effort to reach an end that is usually desirable.\nIn Islam, as al-Raghib said in his al-Mufradat, there are three kinds of this concept according to his words:\n1.       Jihad against a manifest enemy. 2.        Jihad against the Satan. 3.       Jihad against one’s soul.\nThe last two meanings are found in ahadith reported by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad and Abu Dawoud in his Sunan on the authority of Fudalah ibn `Ubayd that he said, “The [true] striver is the one who strives against his soul in obedience to Almighty Allah.”\nIn another weak hadith reported by al-Bayhaqy on the authority of Jabir, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said after returning from his last march to Tabuk “We returned from the minor jihad to the major one.”\nHe also interpreted it to mean combating one’s whims. Moreover, serving parents is a sort of jihad. He (peace and blessings be upon him) said “Strive for their sake.”\nIbn Taymiyyah defined jihad saying: It comprehends all sorts of worship, whether inward or outward, including love for Allah, being sincere to Him, relying on Him, relinquishing one’s soul and property for His sake, being patient and austere, and keeping remembrance of Almighty Allah. It includes what is done by physical power, what is done by the heart, what is done by the tongue through calling to the way of Allah by means of authoritative proofs and providing opinions, and what is done through management, industry, and wealth.\nAs for the first meaning, which is striving against people, this is the most widespread meaning. It is jihad against non-Muslims in the sense of fighting and engaging in war. There are many qur’anic verses and Prophetic ahadith concerning its merits, conditions, and regulations. Its practices through history between Muslims and others have been echoing. Up until now we still hear discussions over this subject ranging from acceptance to rejection, admiration to condemnation. Many have justified aggressive wars and worldly greed under the pretext of jihad. Others neglected jihad and refrained from driving back aggression and resisting the enemy and thus the results were grave. There are many movements that do not abide by the regulations of jihad and thus distorted the image of Islam and caused hardship and loss to Muslims.\nMany unjustly accuse Islam considering jihad as something that needs no justification and that it is a call to constantly fight the non-Muslims as Priest Hanz Fu-King, quoted by Murad Huffman, said.\nThere are many examples like this one in the statements of orientalists by which they justify waging an aggressive war against Muslims to civilise and subdue them.\nThe truth is that the concept of jihad in Islam is not always synonymous with fighting. Jihad is a wider concept. It is a sort of defending the truth and calling to it through the tongue. Almighty Allah said in the chapter of al-Furqan “Persevere in impelling them with this [Quran], with a mighty impelling”; that is, establish the compelling arguments and present to them the proofs one after the other. Obviously, reciting the Quran does not involve military actions. Hence, not every jihad is fighting and not every fighting is jihad. Jihad is also a call for freedom.\nJihad could be a military action. There are military actions that are not jihad. Ibn Khaldun divided wars into four kinds according to their motives. He said that the origin of all wars is the desire for revenge. But two kinds of wars constitute transgression and turmoil: competitive war (expansive war) and transgressive war waged by brutal nations.\nThe other two kinds are just wars: one waged out of anger for the sake of Almighty Allah and His religion, which is the meaning of jihad, and the other waged against those who rebel against authorities, which is a war to safeguard the regime as he called it.\nIn the next article, we will continue talking about the illusions related to the concept and ruling of jihad in Islam.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Answer": "\nQuestion:\nEvery year, we face the same problem of sighting the new moon marking the beginning of Ramadan. Some Muslims here have no faith in our national committee and so fast with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They are mostly Indians belonging to the Tabligh Group who come from Fiji Island to the north of New Zealand. They do not seek to sight the new moon but they depend on a phone call they receive from their homeland, instructing them to start fasting. The youth in our country are of two groups; those who observe fast with our committee and those who observe fast with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, though our committee may sight the moon after some days. Please help us, may Allah reward you! What is your advice to us since I am living here in New Zealand? Peace be upon you.\n\nAll praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, and peace and blessings be upon Muhammad, his family and his Companions!\nScholars hold different opinions regarding the issue of sighting the new moon of Ramadan. Some say that sighting the new moon in one country is sufficient for all other countries to start fasting. The same opinion is held by some Maliki scholars, for Khalil says: “It is binding for all countries.” That is, if two upright Muslims informed that another two upright Muslims sighted the moon, then it is binding for all countries.\nOther scholars say that countries far away from each other cannot depend on each other’s sighting of the new moon. Many scholars hold this opinion, which is based on a Hadith narrated by Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) in the Sahih Muslim (1087). Al-Nawawi commented on the Hadith saying: Each country should depend on its own sighting. Kuraib narrates that Umm Al-Fadl bint Al-Harith sent her son (Al-Fadl) to Mu`awiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) in Sham. Al-Fadl said, “I went to Sham and fulfilled her need. Then Ramadan was about to begin while I was there. I saw the new moon on Saturday night. Then I returned to Madinah by the end of the month. `Abdullah ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) asked me about the moon saying, ‘When did you sight the new moon?’ I replied, ‘We sighted it on Saturday night.’ He asked: ‘Did you sight it yourself?’ I said, ‘Yes, and other people sighted it too. They observed fast and so did Mu`awiyah.’ He said, ‘But we sighted it on Sunday night and we will continue fasting until we finish thirty days or sight the next moon.’ I asked, ‘Do you not depend on the sighting of Mu`awiyah?’ He said, ‘No, that is what the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) commanded us to do.’” Based on this hadith, sighting the new moon in a country far away does not apply, especially if both countries do not share the same hours of night; i.e., the night ends in one country before it begins in the other. The matter is subject to differences among scholars, even among Fiqh academies. The Islamic Fiqh Academy issued a decision that sighting the new moon is the only valid way, and that astronomical calculations based on the relation between the moon, the earth, and the sun can be only used as a guide.\nA third opinion declares that astronomical calculations are decisive and dependable, and this is the opinion of the European Council for Fatwa and Research.\nAs for your question, Muslims may start fasting with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or with any other country as long as sighting the new moon was established according to Shari`ah. They may also seek to sight the new moon in their own country or in a nearby country, since long distances nullify the ruling. Astronomical calculations can also be of great help, especially in this age of scientific advances. It is said that if a needle is sent to space, it can easily be found, let alone the moon which has already entered into its new phase, as it can be seen two or three hours after entering it. Thus, there are various options for Muslims in your country and there is no need for them to disagree. Those who adopt the opinion that says long distances from a country prohibit one from following its timing of the new moon are adopting a strong opinion. Those who adopt the opinion that says sighting the new moon in one country is binding on other countries are also adopting a strong opinion. Those who depend on astronomical calculations to verify or establish the birth of the new moon are also on the right. In case the new moon was seen while astronomical calculations prove it can never have entered its new phase on that date, the sighting is given preference. Although the European Council gives preference to astronomical calculations, if a group of people sighted the new moon, their opinion is given preference over astronomical calculations. This was a summary of opinions in this regard and we advise Muslims to avoid disagreements and disputes. Muslims should discuss the matter together and agree to adopt one of the methods we listed above, for all are opinions of great scholars.\n \nOriginal Source Link\n",

      "Question": "Teaching Physical Education at Girl Schools",
      "Answer": "\nWhat is the ruling on women playing sports and teaching physical education classes at girl schools?\nThis is generally permissible, as long as there is no intermingling between the two sexes and the girls are alone at the school. Exercising is important to build the body, protect the mind, and enhance performance. It is something desirable, unless there is a Shar`i impediment, such as a man and a woman being in privacy or requiring a woman to take her clothes off.\nI would like to advise Muslims against overstrict observance of the rule of blocking possible ways to evil. It is favorable to keep away from imposing unjustifiable constraints over people in something that may be involving no evil at all. If such rule is not applied for some interest, such interest must be significant and reasonable.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Takfir &#038; Its Impacts on Muslim Nation II",
      "Answer": "\nCenturies ago, Takfir (i.e., accusation of blasphemy or unbelief) turned into a phenomenon among Muslim sects. An Ash`ari would accuse a Mu`tazili of blasphemy, allegedly for denying the Messenger’s seeing of Allah, not recognizing Allah’s Attributes, and arguing for the creation of the Qur’an. At the other side, a Mu`tazili would accuse an Ash`ari of blasphemy, allegedly for disagreeing with the Prophet on monotheism, on the grounds that ascribing human attributes to Allah entails that there are others who share the same perfect attributes with Him.\nAl-Ghazali wrote, “This dilemma was caused by ignorance of where to accept and where to deny. To subject a Shar`i text to reasoning without undermining it is something commendable in religion. However, it is falsehood to deny such reasoning outright and deem it nonsense; this is stark unbelief. Accordingly, an innovator in religion is not deemed unbeliever as long as such innovation is based on a sound interpretation of some religious text, corroborated with the fact that the apparent meaning of such text does not apply”.\nThe above, though disapproved by some scholars, places restriction on those who unreasonably use Takfir against others.\n“In the book Jami` Al-Fusulyyin (Reconciler of Factions), At-Tahawi reported our fellow scholars as saying, ‘A person is deemed out of the fold of faith only when he denies what initially brought him into it. Thereupon, what is certainly proved apostasy shall be judged apostasy, and what is not certainly proved apostasy shall not be judged apostasy’. Evident belief in Islam cannot be nullified for doubt. After all, Islam has more priority; a mufti should not act to judge a Muslim unbeliever while judging a person forced to embrace Islam to be a true Muslim”.\nThese opinions are cited as a criterion to judge the cases discussed earlier. Some of these cases were judged to be unbelief, whereas they are not, in light of the above argument. For more details, see Jami` Al-Fusulyyin.\nAlso, as stated in Al-Fatawa As-Sughra (Minor Fatwas), “Unbelief is a grave matter; a believer cannot be deemed unbeliever so long as there is some aspect entailing the opposite”.\nIn Al-Khulasah (The Extract) and other books, it is explained, “If a case involves several aspects that entail unbelief but one aspect that excludes it, then the mufti should give preponderance to the aspect excluding unbelief, as a matter of thinking well of Muslims.” The book Al-Bazzaziyyah (Fatwas by Al-Bazzazi) elaborated more on this: “… unless the person proclaims an express will to do something that implies unbelief, in which case no justification can be pleaded”. Another book, At-Tatarkhaniyyah (Tatarkhani Fatwas), further stated, “Takfir shall not be based on uncertainty, as Takfir is the utmost of punishment, and thus it requires the utmost of offense — whereas uncertainty has no utmost”.\n“To conclude, a Muslim shall not be judged unbeliever as long as his words can be interpreted as having a good implication or his unbelief is controversial, even if on the grounds of a weak narration. Accordingly, most of the sayings allegedly entailing Takfir shall not be judged as a reason for Takfir. I have decided never to give a fatwa of Takfir based on such sayings” [Al-Bahr (The Sea), redacted].\nThe same was stated in the book Tanwir Al-Absar (Enlightenment of Insights) as well as Ibn `Abidin’s commentary on it Radd Al-Muhtar (Answering the Confused). Explaining the saying: “… even if on the grounds of a weak narration”, Ibn `Abidin wrote, “Al-Khayr Ar-Ramli said, ‘… and even if the narration is reported by other than our school of jurisprudence. This is proved by requiring that what necessitates Takfir must be an object of consensus’”.\nIn Al-Fatawa (The Fatwas), Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah stated, “Companions and all Muslim Imams unanimously agreed that not everyone who says something wrong, even if contradicting with the Sunnah, is necessarily to be judged unbeliever. Thus, using Takfir against whoever claims a wrong opinion is against consensus. Takfir is a matter of controversy, which is discussed in detail elsewhere. What is meant here is that no followers of a certain Sheikh or Imam are entitled to use Takfir against others. It is authentically narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “If a man says to his brother, ‘O Unbeliever’, it shall definitely apply to one of them”.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Sufism in Islamic Shari`ah",
      "Answer": "\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful All praise is due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon our master, Muhammad, and upon his family and Companions. Introduction There have long been intellectual disputes among Muslim sects and ideologies, and Sufism is no exception, both in principle and in detail. The present article is focused exclusively on major Sufi thoughts, as these underlie and govern detailed tenets and practices. Any given idea is judged depending on its background rationale and holistic grounds. To better understand it, let’s first investigate what the term “Sufism” means. In his Al-Qawa`id (The Rules), Sidi Ahmad Zarruq enumerated as many as two thousand definitions of Sufism, concluding that the core of Sufism is true orientation to Allah, or Ihsan (i.e., piety and goodness). In An-Niqayah (The Selection), As-Siyuti defined Sufism as “hearty devotion to Allah and holding everything inferior to Him”. Another definition is “rising above vanities towards sublimities”. According to Ibn Abu Sharif, such many definitions are due to taking a major aspect of Sufism as the defining feature of it. It is like the Prophet’s saying, “Hajj is `Arafah”, that is, the ritual of staying at `Arafah is so decisive for validity of Hajj that it can be seen as equal to Hajj itself. Al-Bisti highlighted that variety of definitions in the following lines: People differed on the meaning of Sufi Mistakenly ascribing it to Suf (i.e., wool) But I am certain that it describes A person who is Safi (i.e., purified)\nA good way to make things clear is by comparison. According to Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali, actions are either outward (practice) or inward (belief), and the latter is either good or bad. Sufism is concerned with the inward, while the outward is the scope of Fiqh (i.e., Islamic jurisprudence — which can be defined as understanding particular Shar`i rulings derived from detailed evidence). Anyway, regardless of the name, what matters is how it is understood in general usage. It is the perception of the term that determines whether it is positive or negative. Allah says, {And He taught Adam all the names (of everything)}. What is the essence of Sufism? It is true orientation; it is Ihsan, the third part of this religion, as indicated in a hadith that was like a review of over 20 years of religious education for Companions. The Archangel Gabriel came to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and asked him about the three parts of the great Islamic Message: Islam (i.e., submission), Iman (i.e., faith), and Ihsan. Ihsan is the ultimate perfection and sublimity — it is to feel as if Allah is present with you when you are worshipping Him. Ihsan is a concurrence of worship and that sublime feeling of divine presence. In the hadith referred to above, the Prophet explained Ihsan as “to worship Allah as if you are seeing him”. Meanwhile, Gabriel was confirming what the Prophet said, and Companions wondered about such a questioner who is approving the answer of his instructor: “How odd! How come he is asking him and then agreeing with him?!” Normally, one asks about something one does not know; but confirming the Prophet’s words meant he had already known the answer. Though uncommon, that concomitance of worship and sense of divine attendance had some mention in several writings. Rule 21 by Zarruq acknowledged the knowledge-application association: “It is well known that Sufism exists only when put into practice. Claiming to be a Sufi without really acting as a Sufi is a fraud. Practice is a prerequisite for true Sufism. It is said, Knowledge should be followed by action.\nHow to Achieve Ihsan? Sufism includes various methods, derived from the Qur’an and Sunnah as well as personal experiences of prominent spiritual figures, in line with Allah’s saying: {And in yourselves. Then will you not see?}. Those figures did their best in worship, observed regular extra-rituals, and enjoined them publicly. They performed all religious observances, be they obligatory or supererogatory, and shunned all religious prohibitions, be they haram or detestable. This is the tradition of true Sufis and their followers who avoid worldly pleasures and live piously and ascetically to be deserving of reward in the Hereafter, as Ash-Shatibi described them in his Al-Muwafaqat (The Agreed Upon Issues). Also, they got so engrossed in Dhikr (i.e., praise-giving and extolment of Allah), indulging themselves in the gardens of Paradise, as the Prophet said in an authentic hadith, “When you find the gardens of Paradise, indulge yourselves”. He was asked, “O Messenger of Allah! What are the gardens of Paradise?” He replied, “Gatherings for Dhikr”. The same meaning was referred to in a poetic line by Imam Abu Al-Qasim: The heart gains delight from Dhikr, so seek it keenly And do not abandon the gardens of People of Dhikr, or you will get thirsty Al-Junayd (may Allah confer mercy upon him) said, “We became Sufis not through gossip or debate, but rather through hunger, sleepless nights, and sticking to good deeds”. Sufism has its roots in the Qur’an, Sunnah, and legacy of Salaf (i.e., righteous Muslim predecessors). As an example of the Sufi, Rule 33 by Zarruq cited a hadith related by Al-Bukhari in his Al-Jami` (The Comprehensive Reference). It tells that a man borrowed 1000 dinars. The lender said, “Appoint a witness”. The man said, “Sufficient is Allah as Witness”. He then said, “Appoint a warrantor”. The man said, “Sufficient is Allah as Warrantor”. The lender consented. When the debt came due, the lender was unreachable. So, the man put the money inside a piece of wood, with a patch attached thereto telling the story, and set it adrift, leaving it in the care of the Warrantor he had chosen: Allah. Then, the money was found by the lender. Later on, thinking that the money did not reach the lender, the man came to him with another 1000 dinars, to make sure that the debt was settled. Another example of Sufis is the saying in the Qur’anic verse: {(They say, “We feed you only for the sake of Allah; we wish not from you reward or gratitude. Indeed, we fear from our Lord a Day full of wrath and distress”}. According to the verse, it is Allah’s Satisfaction, not the fear of Him, that motivated them to do good. And Allah knows best!\nA man asked Ash-Shalabi (may Allah confer merci upon him), “How much Zakah is due on five she-camels?” He said, “The prescribed Zakah is a sheep, For us, the five shall be given in charity”. The man asked, “On which grounds are you speaking?” He replied, “Abu Bakr paid all his property in charity for the Sake of Allah and His Messenger. Whoever pays all his property in charity for the Sake of Allah will be following Abu Bakr. And whoever pays some of it will be following `Uthman. And whoever abandons the worldly life altogether this will be unwise”. Al-Junayd said, “Our knowledge is governed by the Qur’an and Sunnah. Whoever does not learn hadiths, accompany Fiqh scholars, and receive education from its people will definitely misguide those who follow him”. As Ihsan is the highest level of the composition of this religion, it cannot be reached unless through the first two levels: Islam and Iman. Naturally, how come a higher floor is built before the ground floor?! That is why it was mentioned last by the Prophet, to indicate that only when one is fully submissive to and having faith in Allah, one can get to Ihsan, the utmost elevation and attainment. The Prophetic expression touches the hearts and removes all limitations of the soul: “… as if you are seeing him”. Knowing that it is too hard to attain, the Prophet informed us that there is a lesser level that is still honorable: Knowledge. That is, if you cannot reach the degree in which you feel as if you are seeing Allah, then put in mind that He is watching you. In the above hadith, the Prophet added, “But since you do not see Him, be certain that He is watching you”. Imagine how blissful, glorious, and ecstatic it is to feel in the presence of the Creator, Exalted be He, with the physical world annihilating and everything losing its material reality. That is Sufism in its spiritual aspect. In terms of knowledge and practice, Sufism is a search for the means and ways to get to such a state, through what is called “levels” — e.g., a level of repentance, patience, thankfulness, certainty, truthfulness, knowledge, heart purification, etc. As Al-Akhdari said in his poem Al-Qudsiyyah (The Sacredness), Desert the pleasures of the world altogether and come And you Allah will love you as much as you tell Him your thoughts The inner state of the hearts and souls are looked for only through that knowledge. This has confused some with inadequate knowledge and awareness. Islam has to do with the knowledge physical actions, through the science of Fiqh. For Iman, there is Usul Al-Fiqh (i.e., Fundamentals of Fiqh). Sufism is the discipline specified by specialists for the ways of reaching Ihsan.\nExamples of Spiritual Purity ·   Hanzalah said, “Once, Abu Bakr came across me and asked me, ‘How are you, Hanzalah?’ I said, ‘Hanzalah is a hypocrite’. He said, ‘My God, what are you saying?’ I said, ‘We gather with the Messenger of Allah while he is reminding us of Paradise and Hellfire so that it is as if we are looking directly at them. But when we leave, we get busy with our wives, children, and property, forgetting much of what we were reminded of’. Abu Bakr said, ‘Actually, we all find ourselves so’. Then, Abu Bakr and I went to the Messenger of Allah, and I said, ‘Hanzalah is a hypocrite, O Messenger of Allah!’ He asked, ‘What is up?’ I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah! We gather with you while you are reminding us of Paradise and Hellfire so that it is as if we are looking directly at them. But when we leave, we get busy with our wives, children, and property, forgetting much if what we were reminded of’. The Messenger of Allah said, ‘By the One in Whose Hands my soul is, if you could ever keep to the state you are in when you are with me and in Dhikr, Angels would shake hands with you when you are in your beds and when you are on your ways. But, Hanzalah, let it be an hour (for worship) and an hour (for pleasure)’. He repeated it three times” (Related by Muslim). ·   Ubay Ibn Ka`b said, “I was at the mosque, and a man came in to pray. He recited a portion of the Qur’an that I found wrong. Then, another man came in and recited a different recitation than that of the first one. We all went to the Messenger of Allah, and I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah! This man recited some recitation that I found wrong, and then the other one came in and recited a recitation other than that of the first one’. The Messenger of Allah asked them to recite, and they did. He commended the recitation of both of them, and Satan whispered into me some doubts that I instantly rejected. When the Messenger of Allah saw how I was, he tapped me on my chest, and I perspired heavily as if I was looking at Allah in fear and awe…” (Related by Muslim). ·   `Umar Ibn Al-Khattab said, “During the lifetime of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), there was a man named `Abdullah, and his nickname was Donkey. He used to do funny things to make the Messenger of Allah laugh. Once, he committed the offense of drinking alcohol, and the Prophet ordered that he should be lashed as a punishment. While lashing, someone said, ‘O Allah! Curse him! How many a time he was punished for that!’ The Prophet said, ‘Do not curse him. By Allah, I know well how much he loves Allah and His Messenger’” (Related by Al-Bukhari).\nThe Prophet instructed his Companions to keep the man’s right to love. Allah says, {And those who have believed love Allah much more}. Ibn Jazi wrote, “Let you know that a servant’s love of his Lord has two degrees. One is general love that no believer shall lack, and it is obligatory. The other is special love possessed only by godly scholars, saints, and pure worshippers. It is the highest level and utmost attainment, as all other levels of the righteous, such as fear, hope, trust, etc., are all based on the purity of the soul. ·   Anas Ibn Malik reported the Prophet as saying, “None of you shall be a true believer unless I am more loved to him than his family, property, and all people” (Related by Muslim). ·   Anas Ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated, “A Bedouin once came to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and asked, ‘O Messenger of Allah! When is the Hour to Come?’ He said, ‘Woe unto you! And what have you prepared for it?’ The man said, ‘I prepared for it nothing but my love to Allah and His Messenger’. The Prophet said, ‘You shall be with those whom you love’. We asked, ‘And so shall we?’ He replied, ‘Yes’. We then rejoiced so much” (Related by Al-Bukhari). ·   In one of his prayers, the Prophet said, “And I Ask You for the delight of looking at Your Face, and I ask You for the longing for meeting You, without any difficult trials or misguiding temptations”. ·   The Prophet said, “I wish I could meet my brothers, as I love them”. Abu Bakr asked, “Are we not your brothers?” He said, “No. You are my Companions. My brothers are those who will believe in me without seeing me and will accept my message and love me so much that I will be more loved to one of them than his father and child. Do you, Abu Bakr, not love people who love you because of my love of you?” Abu Bakr replied, “Yes, O Messenger of Allah”. He said, “Then, love them as long as they love you because of my love of you” (Related by Abu Nu`aym in Fada’il As-Sahabah [i.e., Virtues of Companions], on the authority of Nafi` Ibn Hurmuz Ibn Anas, who is not a reliable narrator; Ibn Qudamah Al-Maqdisi in Kitab Al-Mutahabbin Fi Allah [Book on Con-lovers for Allah’s Sake], 1/70, No. 78). ·   Ubay Ibn Ka`b said, “O Messenger of Allah! I pray for Allah’s blessings for you. How much of my prayers should I dedicate for you?” The Prophet said, “Whatever you like” (Authentically Related, Not Related by Al-Bukhari or Muslim).\nThat space of overflowing love, light, passion, insight, transparency, transcendence, and spirituality must have some container and some action to exist within and by. Actually, it is the inseparability and interdependence of the body and the soul. There must be a discipline with its own rules and terminology to represent such perfection aspired to by the highly-determined. That discipline took various names such as “sermons”, as used by Al-Bukhari, and “asceticism”, as in early Sunnah books. Eventually, it was agreed to be named “Sufism”, just as the discipline of Shar`i rulings was called Fiqh. Critique of Sufism Having its roots in the Qur’an and Sunnah, what problems can Sufism raise? Some 10 problems can be listed below: I. Some pretenders of Salafism (i.e., revival of early Muslim legacy) erroneously and thoughtlessly criticized the very name of Sufism. As we have said, names and terms are only as significant as their content. Allah says, {And He taught Adam all the names (of everything)}. Most Islamic sciences had different names in early centuries of Islam, such as Fiqh; and even specialized terminology, such as Hadith classifications, were once inexistent. Then, they were formalized and mainstreamed to express and give materiality to scientific concepts. I borrow `Umar’s words, “What a good invention it is”. And no need to say more. Many Sufi terms, such as Sheikh, Murid, Salik, Magdhub, Watad, have acceptable meanings. For example, the term Sheikh was used by Hadith scholars in the area of narrator reliability, and Talib, Hafiz, and Hakim were used in Hadith narrator classifications. As-Siyuti wrote, “And let you know that if the ins and outs of the science of Sufism are presented to Fiqh scholars with their own jargon, they will definitely approve of and strongly adopt them. What really discourages them from accepting such concepts is that these are framed in a language unusual to them”. As the saying goes, “Reality is the best to know, but the worst to say”. I will give a proving example: In Manazil As-Sa’irin (Ranks of Walkers), it is written, “The reality of repentance comprises three elements: (1) distinction between Taqiyyah (i.e., religious dissimulation) and `Izzah (i.e., straightforwardness), (2) abandonment of wrongdoing whatsoever, and (3) repentance of repentance. A Fiqh scholar would find the latter term too unusual: How to repent of such a good deed as repentance? Repentance is due of sins. In fact, it means that, when someone is absolutely and perfectly oriented to Allah, he will give no attention to whatever he does, and even repentance, thus repenting of his reliance on repentance”. II. The Sufi practice of undertaking specific portions of regular Dhikr, Qur’an recitation, etc. was another object of criticism. The Prophet determined specific post-Prayer portions and time-free number-bound portions, sometimes advising more. He said, “Except for one who does more than this”, regarding the saying: “There is no deity but Allah, Who has no partner; His is the Sovereignty, and His is the Praise; and He has Power over all things”. He also said, “The deed most loved to Allah is that constantly observed”. A hadith tells us that the Prophet’s “deeds were continuing”.\nIt is reported that Ibn Mas`ud denied that sense of the hadith, but it can be interpreted as referring to someone who does so too much to observe some other more favored deed. Other evidence of permissibility of that is a hadith telling that the Prophet approved a woman who used pebbles or date seeds to enumerate extolments of Allah. That hadith was related by An-Nasa’I, Ibn Hibban, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, and Al-Hakim. It is judged to have an authentic chain of narrators traced back to Sa`d Ibn Abu Waqqas. Also, Abu Hurayra used a thick thread with one thousand knots to calculate his extolments of Allah. How can one enthusiastically keep to Dhirk without counting it? III. One more criticism is the use of rosaries. This is retorted to in the last point. It is better to use the hand in calculation of extolments, unless the regular portion of worship is so long that a rosary is needed. Generally, the use of rosaries is permissible. IV. Gatherings for Dhikr are disapproved by many, on the grounds of the denial by Ibn Mas`ud, which we retorted to above. Also, a counterevidence is an authentic hadith narrated by Ibn `Abbas: “Never some people gather at one of the mosques of Allah…”. Sidi `Abdullah said, Denial is refuted by explicit religious text And any ambiguity is now clarified `Umar used to gather with the public to listen to a certain Qur’an reciter, which was not done by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him). This demonstrates that there is much flexibility in this regard. Also, the people of the Levant used to recite the Qur’an in congregation in early centuries, as Al-Hafiz Ibn Rajab stated in Jami` Al-`Ulum Wa Al-Hikam (Collection of Sciences and Rulings). V. Much criticism goes to the issue of Tawassul (i.e., seeking intercession) and Tabarruk (i.e., seeking blessings), and some even use Takfir (i.e., accusation of blasphemy) against users of such practices, despite the hadith on the blind, which was judged authentic by Al-Hakim, according to the criteria of Al-Bukhari and Muslim, as well as by Sheikh Taqi Ad-Din Ibn Taymiyyah, giving it a special interpretation. That hadith is decisive evidence, and none of the Great Muslim Imams rejected it. Imam Ahmed argued expressly for Tawassul from the Prophet, according to Al-Mardawi. Even if not decisive, it is contradicted by no religious text, but rather by some general notions that cannot stand as evidence.\nVI. One more problem is Istighathah (i.e., seeking help), which is seen as a grave crime that brings one out of the fold of Islam, even if seeking help from the Prophet himself. Related to it is to seek help from other than Allah on things that can be done only by Allah, the Lord; they take seeking help from idols as equal to seeking help from the Master of Creation (peace and blessings be upon him), citing the Qur’anic verse: {If you invoke them (i.e., idols), they cannot hear your invocation, and even if they heard, they would not respond to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will deny your association (of them as partners to Allah)}, as well as other wrongly cited verses. They overlook a hadith related in Sahih Muslim in which the Prophet prayed for `Amir Ibn Al-Akwa`, in addition to `Umar Ibn Al-Khattab’s saying to the Prophet, “Would you please pray that he may live long to benefit us more and more?” A delicate point unknown to many is that levels of attribution vary; an action may be attributed to Allah in a certain consideration and to some created being in another. For example, Allah says, {Allah takes the souls}, and, {Say, “The Angel of Death shall take your souls”}. Here, taking the souls is attributed to Allah in one place and to the Angel of Death in another place. Similar cases are numerous in the Qur’an and Sunnah. There is a hadith on a house owner who sought help from the Prophet after the latter’s death, saying, “Pray for rain for your nation”. He told `Umar and other Companions, and none of them disapproved of it. That hadith is judged authentic by Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar and Al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir. Some denied the Prophet’s knowledge of people’s life affairs, although he said, “Both my life and my death are good for you”, a hadith judged authentic by many, including Ibn `Abdul-Hadi in his well-known school of thought. Generally speaking, lack of evidence does not entail impermissibility; it only means that the matter is flexible but not obligatory.\nAll the above issues fall under the so-called Bid`ah At-Tark (i.e., innovation of abandonment), which I discussed in much detail in my book Mashahid Al-Maqasid (Scenes of Objectives), covering the positions of Ash-Shatibi and others. Among those who differed with Ash-Shatibi was his Sheikh Abu Sa`id Ibn Lubb, who wrote a whole book in retort to his view on post-Prayer congregational supplications. When he knew about Ash-Shatibi’s fatwa in this regard, he strongly disapproved of such supplications, allegedly maintaining that supplications do no good or harm. One of his writings, Lisan Al-Adhkar Wa Ad-Da`wat Mimma Shuri`a Adbar As-Salawat (Tongue of Dhikr and Supplications in What Is Legislated After Prayers), included many arguments proving the public practice. According to him, the biggest problem with this is that it was not done by the Salaf.\nIn fact, this implies only that it is ok to abandon it, but never that it is haram or detestable, especially as it has some general religious grounds like supplications. If it is true that the Salaf did not do it, the Salaf themselves did good things not done by their predecessors such as collecting and punctuating the Qur’an, dividing it into semi-parts, reciting it at the mosque, repeating the Imam’s Takbir (i.e., saying, “Allah Akbar [i.e., Allah is the Greatest]“) during Prayer, flooring mosques with straw mats instead of pebbles, hanging chandeliers at mosques, engraving Allah’s Words and Names on dinars and dirhams, etc. `Umar Ibn `Abdul-`Aziz said, “People experience troubles as much as they do mischief; likewise, they receive encouragement as much as they slack”. It is said, “Most detrimental to worship is slack”. Allah says, {And cooperate in righteousness and piety}. The above examples were quoted from Ibn Lubb, and I can add to them the use of mosque niches and minarets. All such things were innovated and, after some debate, found generally permissible. Among the examples are imitating deceased scholars and trading in Fiqh books, which had initially been controversial and then were deemed permissible. In Tal`ah Al-Anwar (Shine of Lights), we read, Debate on imitation of the deceased And on selling Fiqh books is now resolved The same applies to writing down Prophetic hadiths, as instructed by `Umar Ibn `Abdul-`Aziz in the turn of the 2nd century A.H., upon which only few copies were made. Also, there is the contemplation of Fiqh issues, which had first been introduced in the 2nd century and then was generally accepted. Advocates of the opinion that non-doing does not stand as evidence that it can involve several considerations: 1. The Prophet might leave something permissible because he dislikes it, which implies only removal of blame. For example, when asked why he declined to eat a lizard, the Prophet explained, “It did not exist in the land of my people, so I find myself disliking it”. Also, once, he was served some food containing garlic, but he did not eat it. Abu Ayyub, the host, asked him, “O Messenger of Allah! Is it haram?” The Prophet replied, “No, but I dislike it due to its smell” (Deemed authentic by At-Tirmidhi). Noticeably, the Prophet did not act to tell about the reason for rejection until he was asked.\n2. He might leave something desirable lest people take it as obligatory. For example, `A’ishah said, “And the Prophet never uttered extolments of Allah in the forenoon, while I have always done” (Authentic hadith). Cited by Ash-Shatibi, the hadith indicates that `A’ishah used to offer 8-Rak`ah (i.e., part of Prayer) forenoon extra Prayer and that she said, “Even if my parents were to come back to life, I would never leave it”. The same applied to performing Tarawih (i.e., supererogatory Prayers performed during Ramadan) in congregation. 3. Ash-Shatibi gave another explanation on why the Prophet left certain desirable practices: Lest it would be taken as obligatory after his death if he kept doing them. That is a possible explanation, according to Ash-Shatibi. Also, some Companions left doing some things in public, as indicated by a hadith narrated by Abu Hurayrah and related by Muslim. 4. Some permissible things were left lest they were be thought to be good deeds. For example, Malik did not wash his hands before meals. When the Emir of Medina `Abdul-Malik Ibn Salih offered him water to wash his hands before eating, Malik said, “Indeed, Abu `Abdullah (referring to himself) does not wash his hands before eating”. Actually, he believed that it is ok, as he stated elsewhere; yet, for people not to think it is obligatory, he avoided it, as written in Al-Muwafaqat. 5. The Prophet might leave something because it is not the most favorable, so he would keep to the most favorable. Sometimes, he might rarely do the left thing to indicate its permissibility. For example, it was authentically reported that Maymunah (may Allah be pleased with her) presented to him a towel to dry his loins, but he did not touch it. Imam of the Two Sacred Mosques commented, “If someone uses the towel, this will not be detestable, but rather less favorable”. The Prophet was reported to have once dried his ablution parts. He always made sure to do the most favorable thing, and still do the permissible thing every now and then, demonstrating what is better (his repeated practice) and what is permissible (his rare practice).\nTo sum up, controversy stems from four grounds: 1. Does Bid`ah (i.e., innovation in religion) have one or more types depending on the underlying evidence? 2. Does abandonment while the cause is established in acts of worship indicate prohibition or not? 3. What is the difference between a cause for requirement and a cause for need? 4. What is the difference between associating an abandoned thing to a specific act of worship as a complement of it (thus being impermissible) and not associating it (thus rendering it back to the original state of permissibility or desirability)? I approve of the judgment of Imam Ibn `Arafah, who differentiated between something associated to an act of worship as part of it (which is impermissible) and otherwise. I can add the following three guidelines: 1. It should not constitute a Shar`i ruling (obligation, desirability, etc.) unless having some evidence, such as religious texts commending Dhikr at all times. It is impermissible to claim that such Dhikr is obligatory, except in case it is done in fulfillment of a vow. 2. It should not be associated with a certain reward. Reward and its amount are determined only by the Lawgiver (i.e., Allah). For example, there is a hadith in which a Companion said, “O Allah, Our Lord! Due to You be much, good, and blessed praise…”. Had not it been that the Lawgiver specified that such Dhikr deserves much reward, none should claim a certain reward for it. On the other hand, the hadith indicates that there is no problem if someone comes up with good practices within the limits of his knowledge of Allah’s Names and Attributes. It is not something to be dictated by revelation, as the Prophet did not blame that Companion, but rather approved of his words. 3. The abandoned thing should not be related to some evidence indicating prohibition or detestability.\nSome of the above four guidelines were reported from Ibn `Arafah, the great Maliki scholar. Whoever chooses to leave something out of precaution there will be no blame on him; whoever does good deeds in line with relevant guidelines out of piety that will be something commendable. Where there are controversies open to Ijtihad (i.e., legal reasoning and discretion), there should be no blame, let alone censure or accusation of blasphemy. The Prophet said, “Deeds are judged depending only on the intentions underlying them”. It is a so big issue. To avoid prolonged discussion and to stick to our purpose, I will not spotlight examples from the lives of Companions and the Salaf, illustrating the flexible options possible, both in doing and not doing. And Allah knows best. VII. Among the problems related to Sufism is the authority of Sheikhs. For scholars, it is based only on accompaniment, as understood from the story that Salman and Abu Ad-Darda’ lived together, and when the latter wanted to pray, the former would tell him to go back to bed, knowing that he spent too long in fasting and performing night Prayers. Fiqh scholars cited that hadith as evidence that it is permissible for one who performs voluntary fasting to break his fasting at the instructions of a Sheikh. In Al-Mukhtasar (The Abridged), it is written, “… unless at a superior command like from the father or a Sheikh, even if they do not swear”. In Ash-Shuruh (The Explanations), it is written, “And the instruction by a Sufi Sheikh has priority”. Just as a Fiqh student needs a master to teach him the ins and outs of the discipline, one involved in the field of purification of hearts and souls needs a Sheikh who has experienced the states of piety and nature of souls. VIII. It is well known that visiting the graves of the righteous is central in Sufism, and majority of Muslim scholars deem it permissible, or even desirable, since it falls under the general ordinance and that there is no difference between riding or walking. Regarding the hadith: “No one shall travel to visit a mosque except for three mosques…”, it refers only to someone who takes a vow to pray at a mosque, in which case he need not go to it unless it is one of those three mosques. Al-Hafiz Ibn Al-Jurzi said, “Graves of Prophets and righteous people are places where prayers are likely to be answered. Visits should be paid in compliance with the Shar`i etiquette, i.e., to feel the awe, to pray for them and for Muslims, and to avoid group ceremonies, otherwise it will fall under the prohibition in the hadith: “Do not take my grave after me as a religious memorial” (Related by Abu Dawud in his Sunan).\nA scholar said, Refinement of your heart and praying for the dead And taking a lesson should be your intended goals from visit Regarding paying visits to the Prophet’s grave, the Four Great Imams unanimously agreed that it is commendable and is associated to Hajj and `Umrah, as stated by the Hanbali scholar Al-Wazir Ibn Hubayrah and others. IX. One more problem is the issue of ecstasy, which was elaborately discussed by Sufi scholars like Zarruq. Generally, it depends on the person’s state; if it is out of his control, it is ok, and if not, others should advise him not to do so. For some, it is acceptable only in case of being overwhelmed. In Al-Qudsiyyah, Al-Akhdari wrote, Dancing, shouting, or clapping Purposely during Dhikr is inappropriate The goal of Dhikr is only To remember Allah with reverence and awe Any psychomotor actions are unacceptable Unless caused by overwhelming feelings There are documented many of such cases of overwhelming ecstasy. In his poem Hidayah Al-Mughtarr Wa Kifayah Al-Mu`tarr (Guidance of the Deceived and Help of the Incapable), our great Sheikh `Ali Ibn ‘Af maintained that ecstasy overwhelms only the weak-hearted when swept by divine lights. He said, What confutes falsehood and comes From the Mighty Lord is called Divine Lights Divine Lights are like winds, and hearts are like twigs, fruits, and seeds A man like a weak twig will be affected By any divine light that blows on him\nX. The last problem is the claims of having supernatural power and transcendent knowledge. Basically, there is no problem with this, as the ability of Muslim saints to work miracles is something believed in by the People of Sunnah and is a proof of righteousness and acceptance, but some people may not realize it and consequently deny it. This happened frequently to the righteous Salaf. The denying claims are refuted and strongly disapproved of. The Unseen is absolutely known by the Lord, but He chooses whoever He likes from among His servants (a Prophet, angel, saint, etc.) to let him know about it. Saintly miracles are not at odds with well-established facts or religious teachings. So, whoever denies them should be rejected. Conclusion Sufism is not a separate religion; it is a kind of functional specialization. Allah says, {And leave what is apparent of sin and what is concealed thereof}. It serves to remove inner impurities and refine hearts in line with the Qur’an and Sunnah, Ijtihad of imams, and recommendations of Sheikhs. I call upon Sufis and Fiqh scholars to renew that science, clarifying its virtues, elaborating on its issues, reframing it properly, and refuting the fallacies associated with it. That way, hearts will enlivened, and souls will shine with purity. This will be a revival of religion and religious sciences, as dubbed by the Sufi Sheikh Abu Hamid (may Allah be pleased with him). Through conferences and seminars, they should remove the barriers between Fiqh and Sufism, looking at them as “two peer sciences aimed at indicating Allah’s Rulings and Rights”, as stated by Zarruq in Rule 20 of Sufism. Sufism governs, not is governed by, Sufis. May Allah guide you to your good in this life and in the Hereafter, show you the best path, and grant you all good.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Specifying Some Nights with Certain Worship!",
      "Answer": "\nI am from Sri Lanka. We have a habit on Thursday night of people praying and reading Qur’an often between the Maghrib and `Isha’ prayers. They consider it an important event and do it regularly. Others burn fragrant incense to spread the fragrance while people are reading the Qur’an. Mosques are usually crowded after `Isha’ prayer and the Imam gives a sermon. Is this permissible or it is an innovation in religion?\nScholars differ as to the ruling of this act. Some believe that gathering to read Qur’an and remember Allah is an innovation in religion, while others encourage it. Each group has evidence supporting their view. One group depends on the Hadith where Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “You have done a wrong innovation in religion,” or “Have you surpassed the Companions of Muhammad in knowledge!” The other group depends on the apparent meaning of the authentic Hadith narrated by Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) who said, “No people gather together in one of the houses of Allah, reciting the Book of Allah and studying it among themselves, without tranquility descending upon them, mercy enveloping them, the angels surrounding them, and Allah making mention of them amongst those who are with Him.” Related by Muslim (2699) The apparent meaning of the Hadith supports the permissibility of gathering to read the Qur’an and study it. Once Al-Awza`y was asked about gathering to study the Qur’an after Fajr prayer and he said, “There is no problem with this.” He added, “Hassan ibn `Atiyyah told me that the first person to do so was Hisham ibn Isma`il Al-Makhzumy during the caliphate of `Abd Al-Malik ibn Marawan. Since then people started doing it.” So the matter is subject to different opinions among scholars. Some scholars, like Malik (may Allah be pleased with him), disapproved of what Hisham did, while others found no problem with it. Harb mentioned that he saw the people of Damascus, Homs, and Basra gather to recite Qur’an after Fajr prayer. The people of Sham read the same Surah loudly, in one voice, and the people of Basra and Mecca used to gather and take turns in reciting ten Ayahs while the rest listened. Harb commented, “All that is good and acceptable”, thus disagreeing with Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbaly’s view (stated in his book Jami` Al-`Ulum wal-Hikam). So the matter is debatable among scholars. As regards to what happens in Sri Lanka, I hold the view that it is good. I have been to this country and I encountered many idol-worshippers. Idols are everywhere and people are attached to them. When Muslims gather to recite and study the Qur’an or to remember Allah, without committing any prohibited act such as dancing or mixing with the other sex, this is a good act and no one should admonish them.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Strategy of Tolerance in Face of Terrorism",
      "Answer": "\nThe Vice President of the International Union of Muslim Scholars, Dr. Abdullah bin Bayyah stressed that there are several solutions which can be suggested to fight terrorism, and they can represent a multifaceted strategy based on security, cultural and psychological procedures in addition to the political, economic, and even media means. He said, “We can define a set of controls for the Islamic project proposed to fight terrorism.\nThese controls are summarised in some points, including: defining the concept of terrorism and terrorist behavior; distinguishing between defending the land and honor and terrorism; highlighting the culture of Islamic tolerance; correcting the misconceptions in the cognitive and educational system, especially the concept of jihad, so as not to be confused with the concept of terrorism; emphasising transparency in the case of the accusation against individuals or countries; respecting human rights; stressing the sovereignty of countries in this area in order for the war on terrorism to be more effective; addressing the problem of poverty and respecting the rights of poor countries to self-growth; respecting civilisational, religious and cultural diversity of humanity as being a factor of enrichment and harmony not a factor of clash and distinction; acquitting all religions from the stigma of terrorism, especially Islam; advocating an in-depth civilised dialogue; addressing injustice in the world, especially the injustices practised against the Palestinians; identifying the internationally and locally desired reform which should be comprehensive; and creating mechanisms for security cooperation through which information are exchanged between countries.”\nBin Bayyah defined the causes of the outbreak of terrorism by saying: “The verbal meaning of this term in the Qur’anic verses is that the word ‘rahaba’ and its derivatives are mentioned in the Qur’an in twelve positions mostly related to fear and dread of Allah, the Creator, Exalted be He, although the verse mentioned in the Sura of Al-Anfal (related to the preparation of force to terrorise the enemy) may suggest meanings that some may relate to the terrorism of today. However, conscious contemplation indicates otherwise; that is, the ‘terrorism’ in the Sura of Al-Anfal is used as a deterrent or what is known nowadays as the strategy of ‘prepared force to protect peace’. In addition, this word as appeared in that Sura is directed to the Muslim country not the individuals or groups.\nAs for the currently used term ‘terrorism’, a careful search should be made to define it according to its Western original source in particular. The term ‘terrorism’ first appeared in a supplement to the large Dictionary of the French Academy in 1798 to describe the Government of the French Revolution, which was terrorizing the people in the name of freedom and revolution. Thus, the term ‘terrorism’ was a description of the regime; however, since the end of the eighteenth century it has become a term referring to violence by individuals and groups acting against the law. It was internationally known for the first time by the League of Nations in 1934 as a criminal act intended to create terror and fear.”\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Somalia Conflict &#038; Fatwa Deviation",
      "Answer": "\nEminent Sheikh Abdullah Bin Bayyah, Vice-Chairman of the International Union of Muslim Scholars (IMUS), stated that fatwas permitting killing, as done by some youths in Somalia, are invalid, censuring the use of fatwas as a vehicle for fighting and tribulation, even if under the pretext of defending Shari`ah.\nIn the last episode of “Ash-Shari`ah Wa Al-Hayah” (Shari`ah & Life), broadcast on 15/11/2009 and entitled “Fatwa Industry”, Sheikh Bin Bayyah gave a juristic description of the current status of fatwa in the Muslim World, highlighting the Somali conflict as a demonstration of Muslim misunderstanding of Shari`ah as well as irrelevant application of religious texts.\nThe Sheikh asserted that some Somalis attack others and claim that they do so in line with the principle of Wala’ (i.e., loyalty to whatever belongs to Islam) and Bara’ (renunciation of whatever is against Islam). He addressed them, “This is not true jihad, according to Shar`i evidence and texts. You are ignorant of evidence, heedless of sound interpretation, and mistaken in application”.\nCustomized Fatwas\nBin Bayyah analyzed the Somali model of customizing fatwas in the field of Takfir (i.e., accusation of blasphemy or unbelief) and how they derive rulings. They claim that the government supports unbelievers who should be fought and that whoever supports the government is unbeliever, because it supports unbelievers, which renders it unbelieving.\nCriticizing such defective thinking, Sheikh Bin Bayyah said that not every unbeliever is to be fought and that a government that supports unbelievers should not necessarily be disbelieving. “All such notions are evidently erroneous in Shari`ah,” he confirmed.\nBin Bayyah explained that fatwas are divided into three categories:\n1. Fatwas on large-scale issues that affect the whole Muslim nation, such as war, Takfir, etc. Such fatwas are to be referred to Fiqh academies.\n2. Fatwas on such issues as business, finance, banking, interests, and other contemporary economic questions. Such fatwas are to be referred to reliable specialists.\n3. Fatwas on personal issues that have clear religious texts and well-established rulings, which can be referred to ordinary people with fair religious knowledge.\nFatwa Industry\nBin Bayyah pointed out that fatwa-making is an industry subject to certain prerequisites. According to him, just like different political, economic, and social conditions today, fatwas have become unregulated and dangerously out of order. “Fatwa is not free from such disorder,” he said.\nNoting that there are “readymade fatwas” available on demand, he described such fatwas as inflexible and are most probably deceptive. As regards the fatwas issued by earlier scholars and imams with evidence from the Qur’an and Sunnah, Bin Bayyah said, “When issued, such fatwas were relevant to their times and places.” He stressed that fatwas must fit reality, consider objectives of Shari`ah, and weigh benefits and harms. In other words, fatwas must be applied insightfully based on Shar`i evidence and rulings.\nMoreover, Sheikh Bin Bayyah clarified that over-the-counter or on-demand fatwas are usual specifically in banking. They come too simplifying to conform to the standard rulings. Another type is fatwas that combine both constancy and change. He elaborated, “Such fatwas must be based on three elements: (1) religious texts, (2) objectives of Shari`ah (i.e., weighing of benefits and harms), and (3) circumstantial factors (i.e., when, where, and who). All such dimensions must be considered; if not, fatwas will turn out lame and deficient”.\nBin Bayyah confirmed that fatwa-related problems stem from nonobservance of the golden rule of fatwa-making: to evaluate partial versus holistic matters and then match them together in harmony and consistency. He stressed that regulation of fatwas can be achieved by adopting a systematic methodology — one that has its roots in the Qur’an, Sunnah, and conclusions derived from both.\nBin Bayyah said that fatwas must consider three things: denotations of texts, objectives of Shari`ah, and reality. Without such trio, fatwas cannot be sound or perfect, especially when addressing complicated issues that need a multifaceted perspective. He added, “From this, we can conclude that a jurist should not issue fatwas on his own, especially in matters that need specialist intervention, such as medical experts, economists, etc.”\nAbundance of Fatwas\nConcerning the multitude of fatwas issued by different Sheikhs on TV channels, etc., Bin Bayyah maintained that there are basics to be fully known by every Muslim, such as freedom and innocence, which are beyond question. Queries should be only on varying things. He ascribed the many questions asked to muftis to the “backwardness of the Muslim mentality” in all fields: industrial, political, informative, etc.\nIslamic Banking\nBin Bayyah stated that many jurists are doing well in the economic field, but unfortunately, they at times disapprove transactions and questions approved by Shari`ah, especially in the fields of finance, economics, and banking, and at other times approve transactions that contravene the Islamic system and its key features.\nIn the end, the prominent scholar pointed to the importance of careful scrutiny and consultation with specialists in banking and business, as these are sensitive and highly problematic fields. A jurist or mufti must seek advice from economists and bankers to be able to give the right fatwas, Bin Bayyah concluded.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Smuggling Lawful Meat",
      "Answer": "\nWe smuggle lawful meat across the borders of the country where we live in Europe, because the lawful meat there is doubtful, besides the quantity of meat in this country is little and thus very expensive. Is this permissible? The Muslim community needs this lawful meat. Please give us a fatwa in this regard – may Allah reward you.\nIn the name of Allah, the All-Merciful, the One Who gives Mercy. Peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah. Smuggling, whatever its content, place or source may be, cannot be permitted because it goes contrary to the system of the country where the Muslims live. Muslims have been enjoined to fulfill all their covenants. Thus, they should not contravene this covenant “O you who believe! Fulfill all contracts,” [5:1] “Thus, you shall fulfill the covenant of Allah whenever you make a covenant. And you shall not break oaths after their affirmation; for, indeed, you have made Allah a guarantor over you.” [16:91] Nevertheless, if you can find a suitable way to bring in this meat without directly contravening the system, this will be more proper. Brothers who live in this country can, for example, buy this meat from a neighboring country or take any other means that does not lead to distorting the reputation of Muslims. For, if any of them is caught while doing something like this and the media broadcasts it, this will give a bad reputation to Muslims. Preserving Muslims’ reputation is one of the objectives of the Shari`ah. Allah knows best.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Significance of Educational Reform",
      "Answer": "\nInterviewer: Sheikh Abdullah Bin Bayyah. Can you hear me?\nAbdullah Bin Bayyah: Peace be with you.\nInterviewer: Peace be with you too, Your Eminence. I am asking about your vision concerning the means of reforming religious education.\nBin Bayyah: In the Name of Allah, the Most-Gracious, the Most-Merciful. Peace and blessings be upon our master, Muhammad, and upon his family and Companions. Let me first greet my brother Dr. Taha Jabir Al-Alwani, whom I believe is possessed of a brilliant mentality of Ijtihad (i.e., legal reasoning and discretion) and a comprehensive Shar`i vision that considers holistic objectives of Shari`ah. He is the inspirer of a great intellectual movement. I ask Allah to grant him success.\nTaha Jabir al-Alwani: May Allah bless and reward you.\nBin Bayyah: Educational reform is an issue of utmost importance, not because of the current focus on it, but because it is one of the bases of renewal, which is an obligation on this Muslim nation. Evidently, there are disastrous flaws in our curricula, including deterioration of the scope of juristic Ijtihad, which results in an inability to cope with contemporary issues in transactions and shallow intellectual production in philosophy and humanities, let alone technology. All such necessitates major surgeries, so to speak, to our curricula and educational systems.\nIn addition, as my dear brother Dr. Taha said, there are many faults in our heritage that need to be addressed, a mater that involves much difficulty. Educational reform can and should be accomplished only by open Islamic minds with a firm belief that reform and renewal are not synonymous with destruction of classic legacy — minds that are aware of both the present time and history.\nOur notion of reform is quite different from the Western model of religious reform. For us, reform is Shari`ah-based and covers such Shar`i sciences as the Qur’an interpretation, Hadith, Fundamentals of jurisprudence, Arabic grammar and linguistics, and logic (which was considered the master of all sciences). Yet, Shar`i sciences are so comprehensive that they cannot be reformed unless using a strategy that tightly links basics of Shari`ah to the lived reality. That link is what I call “renewal”.\nThe tools or means for attaining reform are universities, scientific centers, and Fiqh academies. If the Muslim nation, or some of its influential entities, has the will to do so, I believe it will be a first step on the road.\nSo, I commend his call for a reform that links holistic interests to partial interests, considers particularities in light of holistic objectives of Shari`ah, and deals with everything within the context of current reality.\nInterviewer: Thank you, the Eminent Sheikh.\nBin Bayyah: And we have acute shortage in philosophy, in humanities, and in the matching of our concepts and such sciences. Thank you too.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Shura (Consultation) and Democracy",
      "Answer": "\nSome researchers have taken the ruling system in Islam as a Trojan horse and started to deduce from certain historical practices the nonexistence of human rights in Islam and the abolishment of all legal and jurisprudential heritage in the Islamic history as if Muslims over their history lived in a forest where no right or system. Here we are going to make a comparison between democracy and shura.\nThese terms are supposed to be known for all at least. We all know democracy as a political system where people participate directly or through their representatives in practicing the power of authority.\nThe reference of Democracy\nThe reference of democracy is purely human and refers to the Roman-Greek system of rights; particularly the Greek laws, the most important stage of which seems to be the reform of the constitution of Athena in 508-507 BC- and shortly before at the hands of Solon- when the Athens brought up a new political system and a new ruling body for Athena. This Roman-Greek heritage remained latent for not a short time to be developed later at the hands of the philosophers and the men of law in Europe like, John Adams, Frederic, Sales, Rousseau, and Montesquieu and others.\nShura is an Islamic ruling system. It represents a deep search to come up with a pleasing solution. Shura is a principle and a system to which the gracious Quran and the Prophetic Sunnah called. It is mentioned in the Quran in three contexts:\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) was ordered to observe Shura “And take counsel with them concerning the [community’s] affairs” [3:159], which means asking for others’ opinion and not being arbitrary. The “affairs” stands for the affairs of life including politics and ruling systems.\nThe second context is in the description of the noble consolidating society that pleases Almighty Allah who said “Those who furthermore answer [the call of] their Lord and [duly] establish the Prayer and [conduct] their affairs by consultation among themselves and spend [charitably] out of what We have provided them.” [42:38] These are four characteristics: answering the call of Allah and observing the Prayer in addition to two other characteristics related to dealing with people; namely, shura and spending charitably out to the needy.\nThe third context is about the family life as it deals with the responsibilities of the parents to raise up their infant; particularly if they want to determine the period of nursing. He exalted is He, said “But if both [parents] desire to wean [the child] by their mutual consent and consultation, then there is no blame on either of them.” [2:233]\nThus two of these contexts are concerned with the ruling system and politics and the third is concerned with family affairs. Hence, we perceive that shura is a comprehensive system that covers all fields of life.\nSo, we can distinguish the most important two kinds of shura: shura in fiqh (Islamic law) as mentioned in the texts and shura in the ruling system and politics. The principle of shuraabides by the most important principle of the shari`ah, which is the independence of the shari`ah from the ruling regime and the rulers. The application of this fundamental principle requires that the practice of shura within the scope of fiqh should serve an exchange of opinions and an independent scientific discussion that is separated from the practice of shurain the field of ruling and politics. Consequently, the political upheavals that could cause dysfunction of shura with regard to choosing rulers and holding them accountable do not necessarily result in the dysfunction of shura in the field of shari`ah and fiqh; that is, in the field of ijtihad and consensus. This is what has protected fiqh over the history of Islam from the impacts of deviations of the ruling systems from abiding by shura in the choice of the rulers, and therefore, this deviation did not result in the dysfunction of shura in the field of fiqh which has stood independent, lofty, and unaffected by the rulers’ deviations.\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) praised shura and practiced it in life affairs. His companions were aware of that and sometimes they offered their opinions after some regular reservations such as saying “Is this [attitude] based on revelation or on personal opinion?” If he told them that this was based on personal opinion, they would give their opinions; and in many cases the situation changed and he abandoned his own opinion.\nBut the Quran left to the ummah (Muslim nation) the details and outlines of this universal principle according to their renewing interests and developing needs.\nThe first test for the awareness of this ummah and its ability to apply the principle of shurawas after the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), for he did not appoint a successor after him. He explicitly assigned a deputy with regard to leading people in Prayer, but He left the appointment of the caliph and the head of the state to the nation. His companions were divided into two groups: the group of al-Ansar (the Helpers), who were the original inhabitants of Median, and the group of al-Muhagereen (the Émigrés), the people of Mecca,. They convened in the house of the leader of al-Ansar and exchanged opinions and arguments.\nThen alliance was paid by the public at the mosque and in other places that Islam reached such as Mecca.\nMuhammad Asad, an Austrian Muslim, claimed that this was the first democratic experience. It may not be democratic in the Western sense, but it was at any rate a great human experience. Such noble, half-Bedouin people, who were strong fighters, convened without arms to discuss without any use of insulting words or threats to agree on selecting one of them. The one they selected said in his first public speech after assuming presidency, “I have been elected to be in authority over you, though I am not the best among you. Obey me as long as I obey Allah. However, if I disobey Him, no obedience will be due to me upon you.” Moreover, the fact that Sa`d ibn Ubadah, the head of al-Anasar, refrained from paying alliance, though his son paid it, and none said a word or objected to him indicates that something big has changed in the life of the Arabs. The age of shura has started.\nAl-Mawirdy has determined the functions of the head of the state in ten points; some of them are religious responsibilities, such as watching over good practices of the obligations of the religion including Prayer, Fasting, and Hajj-pilgrimage; and some are secular functions, such as collecting money, protecting the borders of the state against any external or internal aggression and ensuring internal security through the application of the shari`ah to protect souls and properties and ending disputes through the appointment of judges.\nAll these procedures aim eventually to protect fundamental human rights. The right of obedience is opposed by the duty of establishing justice and fairness. This is indicated by the pledge of alliance, which is the best way to elect the highest authority in a state or kingdom. The pledge of alliance is like a contract between two parties: the ruler on the one side and the subjects on the other side. Abu Bakr, the first caliph expressed this nature of the contract when he said, “I am but an employee for Muslims.”\nBut there is a third dimension, which is the religious dimension and the ethical bond of the pledge of alliance which puts responsibility on both parties with regard to its role and demands sincerity and honesty. The ruler has to do sincerely all his duties in full with justice and fairness and to appoint competent persons in the positions of commissioned and executive ministries, as called by al-Mawirdy. The sincerity of the subjects is manifested through helping the ruler in his tasks and giving him counsel and advice within the frame ofshura, which is a system that complements the system of the pledge of alliance. It is an inevitable Islamic obligation that requires guiding and straightening up the rulers according to the statement of the second caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) who said to the subjects, “If you see any crookedness in me, straighten me up.”\nBut the nature of shura differs from public criticism and open condemnation which may turn into an armed dispute. It is a quite search for the correct opinion with fair means and with public interest as the ultimate goal. If well employed, the system of shura can correct the course of the state.\nThis third dimension in the system of the pledge of alliance and shura distinguishes it certainly from the social contract as seen by Jan Jack Rousseau owing to its religious source as well as its other consequences. But the system of the pledge of alliance was applied by the companions (may Allah be pleased with them) first in the form of direct pledge of alliance given after a nomination from the preceding ruler to a person known as a crown prince and then in the form of appointing a shura council to select someone from among them. This indicates that this system responds to the needs of time and place to achieve benefits, keep away evils, terminate turmoil, and block the reasons of war before its eruption. Nevertheless, the rights and duties in Islam are sure and confirmed.\nThe most important support of human rights in the shari`ah is the independence of judiciary. The judge refers to nothing but the shari`ah and his conscience points out this independence. This is indicated by the message sent by `Umar, the commander of the believers (may Allah be pleased with him), to Mu`awiyah, his governor over Syria and Palestine, where he said, “You have no authority over `Ubadah ibn al-Samit”, who was the judge of Palestine. Here `Umar, thus, puts an end to the interference of governors in the judiciary affairs.\nIt is well known that the fourth caliph Ali, commander of the believers (may Allah be pleased with him) stood with a Jew before his judge Shurayh who judged in favor of the Jewish man over the caliph.\nEven the Islamic state was judged against by its court in the famous case of Samarkand. The Muslim army seized the town; but its people raised objection concerning not respecting the legal procedures on the part of Muslims. An Islamic court was held after verifying the case and it judged that the Muslim army had to withdraw.\nDuring the Abbasid time the caliph kept himself away from appointing judges and appointed only the judge of the judges, who had to be the greatest jurist known for knowledge and piety and who was entrusted to appoint and dismiss judges. The caliph had no longer any business in this regard.\nBefore his death Abu Bakr made a will to appoint `Umar as his successor and people gave him the pledge of alliance. `Umar, the commander of the believers, assigned six of the senior companions, whose authority were beyond dispute and who were publically acceptable due to their early conversion to Islam, strive for the cause of Allah, and sincerity, to elect a caliph and commanded them to remain convening until they appoint a caliph. They remained three days and some of them did not sleep. They kept consulting and seeking counsel from people until they agreed upon `Uthman ibn `Affan. According to an authentic narration, leaders of the soldiers who came from Syria, Iraq, Persia, and Egypt to meet the caliph gave him the pledge of alliance. For the first time the leaders of soldiers were mentioned explicitly in the shuraaffairs.\nThus shura was applied in the most serious issue, namely, the sovereign power. But it was practiced also in many of the issues, as the caliph had counselors for every affair. But sometimes he sought the opinion of the public. `Umar informed people with his intention to set a maximum limit for the dowry paid for women, whereupon a woman quoted in response the Quranic verse that says, “And you have given the first of them [as much as] a [heap of] gold in dowry.” `Umar then submissively said: A woman spoke the truth and `Umar spoke wrong.\nLet us admit that during the period of the guided caliphs shura concerning serious issues of the state was the task of prominent persons and influential people from among the Emigrants and the Helpers. But it was a pioneering experience in the old heritage of humanity. But the flexibility of the experience and the various forms it took made it developable beyond ready-made forms. The principle affirmed strongly, as clarified by `Umar in his last speech, was that “No one shall be given the pledge of alliance without people consent lest he may be killed along with those who follow him”, as reported in Sheeh al-Bukhary.\nThis simply means that people’s consent is a must, because contravening this leads to turmoil and fighting.\nThis is likely what the democracy of the majority aims at. It cannot please all the people, but it keeps people away from wars. This is the best that representative democracy provides. It is based on the system of two poles, as Olivient Duhamel said in his book les democraties. The basic law of the democracy of the ruling majority is the system of two poles or two parties. The voter has, in most cases, to vote for a whole list even if he sympathizes only with some of the allied persons. If he insists to vote for one individual in the list, his voice will be invalid.\nIt could be said that such polarization may prevent from choosing an actual person. But the point of the process is not to express a personal opinion but to translate the voices of the individuals into a final result with the aim of coming out with a ruling majority.\nAnyway, in return for this defect in the bipolar partisan system a great merit appears. Competition between the two camps does not lead to the escalation of the dispute into the eruption of a civil war between the Right and the Left. It rather helps alleviating the disputes and finding a peaceful solution for them.\nShura meets with democracy in the point of looking for a peaceful solution. The system ofshura pours into one stream, which is Islamic justice that is able to secure for man such a good end that democracy is thought to be looking for. Democracy is but a stage in human invention but may not be the last one.\nSomeone may ask: How was shura practiced and how it should be practiced?\nThis is quite a legitimate question. I mentioned before that the reference of this paper is Islam. Islam is an ideal that should be reached; and the closer we come to it the better justice will be achieved and the happier man will become.\nThis system is not rigid or stiff but developable and can benefit from human experiences that respect invariables and authoritative references and assess priorities together with social and security necessities.\nIn the early period of Islam there was the system of headmen and foremen, as found in the accounts of the prophetic biography. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) commanded people to choose those who would speak in their name, as in the case of the pledge of alliance given the headmen of the Helpers in Mecca –known as Bay`at al-`Aqabah. Similarly, in the case of the battle of Hunayn he (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “Let your foremen inform me”, because he did not know the attitude and content of the people with regard to his suggestion and so he ordered that they should choose those who would convey their opinion concerning the prisoners of the war with Hawazen. This account is inSaheeh al-Bukhary.\nThe system of headmen and foremen is quite resemblant to the system of representative elections. An example of this is the case of the pledge of alliance paid for the third caliph `Uthman ibn `Affan (may Allah be pleased with him). Ibn Katheer reports, “`Umar ibn al-Khattab appointed six persons to consult over the affair. They were: `Uthman ibn `Affan, `Ali ibn Abu Talib, Talhah ibn `Ubaydullah, al-Zubayr ibn al-`Awwam, Sa`d ibn Abu Waqqas, `Abd al-Rahman ibn `Awf (may Allah be pleased with them). He refrained from specifying one of them and said ‘I would not shoulder your responsibility in my life and in my death. If Allah desires well, He will unify you to agree on the best of them as He unified you to agree on the best among you after your Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him).’\nAfter finishing with `Umar, al-Miqdad ibn al-Aswad gathered them in the house of al-Miswar ibn Makhramah. It was said that this was in the chamber of `Aishah and was said also that this was in the state treasury and was said that this was in the house of Fatimah bint Qays, sister of al-Dahhak ibn Qays. But the first is more likely. Allah knows best.\nThey sat together and Abu Talhah stood to keep others away. `Amr ibn al-`As and al-Mughirah ibn Shu`bah sat behind the door, but Sa`d ibn Abu Waqqas pebbled and dismissed them saying “Have you come to say ‘We attended the shura council!’”\nIt is reported that the people of shura council delegated `Abd al-Rahman ibn `Awf to do his best to appoint the best of them. It is said that he asked as far as he can and none, neither from the people of shura nor others, but gave preference to `Uthman ibn `Affan. Even when he said to Ali: If I would not appoint you, who would you suggest, O Ali?” He said, “`Uthman”. And when he said to `Uthman, “If I would not appoint you, who would you suggest?” He said, “Ali ibn Abu Talib.”\nThis was apparently before confining the matter to three from among them and then `Abd al-Rahman withdrew to see the best of them for Islam and appointed, after doing his utmost, the best of the two men.\nThen `Abd al-Rahman ibn `Awf (may Allah be pleased with him) consulted people about them and met with headmen and soldiers as individuals and as groups, privately and publically. He even reached out women in their concealments and children in their schools and asked caravans and Bedouin who came to Medina during the three-day period. He found no two persons differing over giving preference to `Uthman ibn `Affan- with the exception of reports that `Ammar and al-Miqdad recommended Ali ibn Abu Talib. Nevertheless, they paid the pledge of alliance with other people as will be mentioned.\nAssuming this responsibility for three days, `Abd al-Rahman did not sleep much and kept praying, supplicating, asking Allah to guide him to the best, and asking people of opinion as well as others. He found none giving preference to other than `Uthman ibn `Affan (may Allah be pleased with him).\nOn the eve of the fourth day of the death of `Umar ibn Khattab, he came to the house of his nephew, al-Meswar ibn Makhramah, and said: Are you sleeping, Meswar? By Allah, I have not slept much since three days. Go and summon Ali and `Uthman. Al-Meswar said: Which one should I start with? He said: Anyone you like. He said: I went to Ali and said: Answer my uncle. He said: Did he command you to summon anybody else with me? I said: Yes. He said: Who? I said: `Uthamn ibn `Affan. He said: Which one he mentioned first? I said: He gave no command in this regard but rather said ‘Summon anyone of them you like first.’ So I came to you. He said: Thus he came out with me. When we passed by the house of `Uthman ibn `Affan, Ali sat until I entered. I found him praying witer Prayer along with Fajr Prayer. I summoned him and he said to me the same as Ali said to me and then he came out. Then I enter with both of them upon my uncle who was praying. When he finished, he faced Ali and `Uthman and said: Let me take pledge from each one of you that if I appoint him he will observe justice and if I do not appoint him, he will hear and obey. Then he got out with them to the mosque wearing the turban that the Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) gave to him and held a sword. He sent to prominent figures from among the  Émigré and the Helpers and it was called “Come to congregational Prayer!” Thus the Mosque was so filled with rows of people that `Uthman found no place to sit in except at the rear of the people as he was a bashful man (may Allah be pleased with him). Then `Abd al-Rahman ibn `Awf ascended the pulpit of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessing be upon him) and stood on the same step the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) stood on and he kept standing for a long time muttering a long supplication unheard by people. Then he said: O people, I asked you privately and publically, in pairs and individually and I found none of you give preference to other than any of these two men  either Ali or `Uthman. Stand up and came here `Ali: Ali stood up below the pulpit. `Abd al-Rahman took his hand and said: Will you give me pledge [to stick to] the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and to the deeds of Abu Bakr and `Umar? He said: No, but to do my best and utmost in this regard. Thus he released his hand and said: Stood up `Uthman. He took his hand and said: Will you give me pledge [to stick to] the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and the deeds of Abu Bakr and `Umar? He said: Yes. Then he raised his head to the ceiling of the mosque while his hand was in the hands of `Uthman and said: O Allah, listen and bear witness. O Allah, listen and bear witness. O Allah, listen and bear witness. O Allah, I have rendered the trust of this affair from around my neck to the neck of `Uthman. Thus, people so crowded to give pledge of alliance to `Uthaman that they overwhelmed him below the pulpit. He said: Then `Abd al-Rahman sat at the place where the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) used to sit and made `Uthaman sit below him on the third step. People came to give the pledge of alliance to him and Ali ibn Abu Talib was the first to give the pledge. It was said also that he gave it later.”\nThis story bears many lessons and deserves analysis. It shows how the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) devised ways and means at that time to know the opinions of people and to reach consent with regard to the choice of the ruler. It also shows the importance of choosing the most competent and the most agreeable. It also manifests the religious and spiritual aspect of the pledge of alliance as `Abd al-Rahman supplicated to Allah and asked Him to bear witness to the process.\nThese elements distinguish the Islamic shura from other systems, though it meets with some other systems in the denial of despotism and repression.\nOver the Islamic history after the first generation other models of shura were found. I shall give one example; namely, the reign of Jahour in Andalusia known as “the governing body” early in the fifth century. Professor Muhammad Abdullah `Anan said, “Jahour was the head of a special kind of government. He did not rule solely or managed and decided the affairs autocratically. Rather, he gathered around him the elite leaders and headmen and he spoke in their name or in the name of the body. He referred the issues to them and the decisions were issued in their names. When he was asked for money or any other affair, he would say, “I have no authority to give or withhold. Only the body has this authority and I am their secretary.” If something of significance comes up or he intended to manage a serious issue, he would summon and consult them. If a letter was directed to him, he would not look into it unless it was in the name of the ministers. Thus Jahour spoke and decided every affair in the name of the body not in his own name. Along with this, Jahour took another brilliant procedure. He did not change his ministerial position and did not move from his house to the palaces of the caliphs. He only arranged door attendants and retinues just as the situation during the caliphate was. He kept himself in authority until a suitable person would come to render authority to him. He arranged men to receive the sultanic wealth and he was the supervisor over them. He did not assume any title or take procedure to manifest his sovereignty or surround himself with any manifestation of splendor and magnificence. He rather maintained his previous condition of seclusion, modesty, contentment, and easygoingness treating all with clemency and good manners. He amended judiciary and worked to observe justice between people. He abolished all sorts of lavishness and extravagance and alleviated taxes. He preserved public funds; particularly the sultanic wealth which he entrusted to trustworthy men over whom he himself was the supervisor. He acted to encourage financial transactions and trade. He distributed money among them as debts they used and got only the profit. They had to keep them and from time to time they would be held accountable for them. The result of these procedures was that welfare took the place of depression, markets thrived, prices became better, houses were profitable, and resources grew.”\nShura and democracy differ in the following points:\nFirst, the reference of shura:\nThe reference of shura is divine, but the application is human. This means that it is man who chooses the ruler through the process of paying the pledge of alliance and shura and it is up to him to set the systems that guarantee the success of the process.\nThese systems may be affected by time and place and by the public interest that constitutes the basis of the shari`ah, according to the words of Ibn al-Qaiyyim. Nevertheless, a distinguished characteristic of the Islamic system is the belief that everything belongs to Allah, for He is the Creator of this universe but He did not leave people after their creation. He rather gave them commands and prohibitions. This relation between creation and systemization is pointed out by the verse, “Most surely, to Him belongs all the creation and all the command. Blessed be God, Lord of [All] the Worlds.” [7:54] Allah is High and the Most High, these are of His attributes and names, but He, nevertheless, is near to His creation. He is nearer to them than the jugular vein. Man is but a successor in this earth, “Now, behold! Your Lord said to the angels: I am placing upon the earth a [human] successor [to steward it].” [2:30] Man is a successor and none is the sole ruler.\nThis dualism between the absolute sovereignty of the Creator with regard to the command, which stands for the fundamentals and invariables of the legislation and the determination of the truth and falsehood, and the possibility- or rather the injunction – that man should use his mind and thought to reach the public interest may be the reason for some to refrain from describing the Islamic system as democratic or theocratic or aristocratic; because none of these systems applies to it.\nThe symmetry of this duality constitutes the cornerstone in the Islamic system and this is what keeps it away from theocracy which is a divine delegation of authority to the ruler. This is more clarified by the words of `Umar ibn al-Khattab, the second caliph, when his scriber wrote in a message he ordered him to write “This is what Allah has shown to `Umar”, whereupon `Umar reproached him saying “Write: ‘This is what `Umar views.’” This is because such description is only restricted to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him). `Umar intended to bear the responsibility of his opinion, be it right or wrong.\nTherefore, the censorship is three-folded to ensure proper application of man’s proper application of his succession in the earth “Therefore, say [to them]: Do works [of righteousness]! For God will assuredly see your work, and so will His Messenger and the believers.” [9:105]\nThe watchfulness of Allah effects religious scruple and that of the messenger of Allah leads to following his shari`ah as explained by the scholars. Therefore, the Moroccan scholar al-Yusy said to Sultan Mawlay al-Rasheed, “Scholars judge over ruler.”\nAs for the supervision of the believers, the pledge of alliance is given by them and so is the consultation. Thus the nation is the source of governance in a sense.\nNevertheless, the pledge of alliance is considered a religious bond between the ruler and the subjects. Obedience to the ruler depends on the application of the shari`ah. The people ofshura are guarded by stipulating their piety and righteousness. Thus the ethical and religious side has a share in addition to the secular side. This is an important and subtle characteristic in the Islamic system that caused some researchers to claim mistakenly that one of the early Muslim caliphs was secular; but this was not as he thought. The nature of the Islamic system gives people a big role not only in the application of rulings but also in their deduction and even their establishment according to a set of evidences known as istihsan (juristic preference) and masalih mursalah (unrestricted public interests) with full respect to the invariable objectives of the Islamic shari`ah.\nThus, when dealing with democracy, a Muslim may feel unfamiliar with its reference, though some may view this as a terminological issue.\n Second: the polls\nResorting to polls as a basis of democracy to take a decision without establishing a background and an impenetrable ceiling constantly brings about a resentful group, namely, is the minority which could be about half of the voters. This makes the majority less inclining to reconciliation and balancing between interests. If there is no established tradition with the individuals that the opinion of the majority, which is not on their side, is correct and that they should sacrifice their interests on the basis of other considerations of interest such as considering this as the best possible or the best ever,if this is not established in minds and practice, democracy will turn to be a source of constant dispute and disorder. Belonging to a party could be the only way for an individual to have some freedom or to practice a serious political activity and contribute through the party leader or the sectarian class that dominates the party. Accordingly, the independent individual who does not go with partisanship and its techniques will be considered isolated and ineffective no matter how high his opinions or thought may be or he will be treated as a second-class citizen. It is noted that the slogan of democracy opens a wide door for partisanship and for the evils of partisan bigotry and thus the existence of too many parties has become a danger for the stability of the western liberal democracy which has been torn by uncontrolled whims. On the contrary, excessive domination of one party is the worst evil that plagues public, communist, or military democracy and leads to despotic collective dictatorship exercised by a party that monopolizes the political activity and prevents anyone who does not belong to it from practicing his political rights on equal footing with the members of the party.\nOn the contrary, the principle of shura opens a wider door for thinkers and intellectuals to contribute with their opinions as individuals regardless of their partisan orientation and thus they contribute in the cultural, social, political, or economic activity more than under democracy that is based on the majority and multi-party system that opens the door for partisan extremity which misuses the principle of the supremacy of the majority. Therefore, the abolishment of parties has become the slogan of revolutions and de coup. Hence, some of the advocates of shura oppose the partisan systems.\nThird: media\nThe voter falls under kinds of deception; particularly through modern media that has possessed massive ability and high potency to exercise influence the public opinion and to introduce the bad as the best and the ugly as the most beautiful.\nTherefore, it has not become a characteristic of the third world to elect a person with the majority of votes and then after a while he becomes accused of corruption and other charges. This indicates that the choice was influenced by propaganda in addition to the influence of other unfair means and this makes public interests a victim of individual interests or personal whims.\nConsultation or shura, in our view, is not a goal in itself. In Islam it is only a means to achieve justice and to execute the objectives and principles of the shari`ah. It is one of the branches the shari`ah.\nThus, we are keen to distinguish shura from democracy. The status quo attests to that the most boastful countries in terms of democracy are the most aggressive and corrupt countries in the world. They persist in exploiting and isolating weak countries, and this takes place with very democratic decision they take after free consultation that pleases their whims, interests, and greed without any commitment to a divine, ethical, or human principle if this principle will prevent them from achieving their desires and greed.\nDemocracy should not be a new religion. This is what Hubert Vedrine, French foreign minister, said in a meeting with more than 100 countries in Francovia. He said, “The West inclines to consider democracy as new religion and calls people to embrace”; and Madeleine Albright, former American Foreign minister, replied, “Democracy is not a religion but a faith and conviction.”\nThis should not be perceived as a decisive refusal of democracy or denial of an important, peaceful, political development that Europe produced in its milieu and that set massive efforts free.\nLikewise, countries that went far away from their religious legacy and inherited the governance through de coups may be more worthy of practicing democracy on the basis of the rule of balancing between benefits and corrupts.\nDemocracy should even be generalized in the international relations as stated in the Charter of the United Nations that speaks of equality between big and small countries and not to confiscate the opinions of the latter countries. But speaking in the name of the international community has become synonymous to the free world. “The United States of America and its Western allies use the international body and its subsequent international institutions, such as the Monetary Fund and the International Bank, to achieve their interests.”\nAl-Shawy views that the essence of shura is to hold dialogue and reach conviction. As for democracy, the center of it is the power of the majority, which it uses to practice absolute authority and thus doors open wide to compete and struggle to gain this power or absolute authority. It may also use it against those who compete with or oppose it and hence violate human rights.\nHe says, “The concept of shura that the Quran enjoins as an Islamic rule to the system of the nation and the society means the freedom which the creed and the high ideals of the society guard. Consequently, legal guarantees for individual freedoms, social justice, political equality are principles derived from the divine shari`ah not from the decisions of the majority- whether in a constitutional form or in a positive law form. It is not under the mercy of the authority of the majority that enacts new constitutions and positive laws and changes them from time to time. They are established principle imposed by our shari`ah. Thus the shura enjoined by the Quran is a positive advanced step, because it provides our social and political systems with established creedal and ethical elements that protect them against the changes of the regimes and the whims of the power of the majority or the minority and against deviation, development, and change that have afflicted the imported democratic principles that match with the unsettled changing European philosophies that are applied in systems that adopt secularism and deny divine shari`ah under the pretext of its being rigid and unchanging and that it limits the authority of the majority in the name of which they demolish everything that prevents them from reaching their desires and changing goals.”\n\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Shar`i Supervision of Financial Transactions",
      "Answer": "\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most-Gracious, the Most-Merciful\nAll praise is due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon our master, Muhammad, and upon his family and Companions.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nHere comes Islamic Shari`ah to mediate between the West and the Islamic World in the field of business. Mathematics, with Al-Khwarizmi, and Islamic (or let’s call it “Greek-Islamic”) philosophy, with Averroes, have for so long been mediating between the two worlds across the Mediterranean See.\nAverroes is still alive in his masterpiece, which is considered a comparative study of Islamic Shari`ah, especially the chapters on financial transactions. Identifying five kinds of Shar`i problems that can affect contracts, he made an exquisite codification based on the texts of the Qur’an and Sunnah, juristic reasoning, practical experience, and consideration of the public interest.\nIntroduction to Islamic Shari`ah\nI find it relevant to start with an introduction to Islamic Shari`ah. It can be defined as a “set of rules, criteria, principles, and detailed rulings that cover ethics, behavior, and transactions in all their dimensions”. It combines faith and worship with good practices, thus placing values at the center of transactional rules and cooperation at the center of human relations.\nThat is why Islamic Fiqh is based on both divine texts and teachings (the Qur’an and Sunnah) and human effort over centuries to interpret such texts via the best methodologies of reasoning. It is not a hermeneutical approach to holy books using linguistic analysis, but rather an employment of Aristotelian (sometimes sophisticated) methods, such as deduction, induction, analogy, syllogism, and all other reasoning techniques.\nIn the 8th century, Fiqh scholars integrated Greek heritage with Fundamentals of Fiqh, combining together philosophical dialectics and consideration of the general interest, customs and traditions, and geographic factors. This Fiqhi effort resulted in excellent legal writings and encyclopedic schools of thought, all stemming from religious and moral principles and values while taking into account necessities of life and people’s needs.\nWith its clear principles, well-organized rules, openness, and flexibility, Islamic Shari`ah provides a good substitute for manmade economy, as they both integrate.\nThese are the underlying grounds of Shar`i supervision, which can be divided into three stages or levels: pre-supervision, formative supervision, and post-supervision.\nSupervision serves to:\n1. Ensure compliance by banks and financial institutions with Shar`i rulings, depending on the choices adopted by such institutions,\n2. Boost client trust by showing that transactions are Shari`ah-compliant, and\n3. Provide alternative financial vehicles and create new financial products.\nThe role of a Shari`ah supervisory board is to approve the institution’s rules and regulations and co-shape its policies. It is not an optional extra; Islamic institutions must rely on some Shar`i resource, whether supervisory or advisory, to ensure compliance with Shari`ah.\nIt is worth mentioning that pre-supervision is crucial. At the phase of establishment of an institution, a Shari`ah board is necessary not only to help “Islamize” the institution, but also to attract more potential financers. So, founders usually seek notable jurists and financial advisors to put their names on the memorandum of association (you can find the same figure working for several banks and institutions at the same time).\nFirst, founders develop a draft blueprint of the institution’s structure and business activities, which may be derived from existing (and sometimes traditional, non-Islamic) institutions. Then, they discuss it with the supervisory board to decide what is acceptable and what is not and what conditions need to be added.\nThis way, the supervisory or fatwa board (or whatever name it is given) goes hand in hand with the institution and gives it an accreditation certificate, which is renewed annually with a report submitted to the board of directors by the end of the fiscal year. This report is necessary to ensure that the institution is on the right track and abides by Shari`ah. It is like the report of the auditing institution on the Treasury.\nSupervisory Boards\n1. The fatwa and Shar`i supervision board gives fatwa and answers inquiries from all parts of the institution; examines different business activities for compliance with Shari`ah; and considers contracts, investment operations, and financial products to be adopted by the institution.\n2. In modern management, internal Shar`i supervision is a comprehensive supervisory system developed by the institution in line with the criteria and regulations approved by the Shari`ah board. It is distinguished from Shar`i review, which is one component of internal Shar`i supervision and is an administrative department or division within the organizational structure.\nInternal Shari`ah supervision is a body affiliated to the bank’s management and entrusted with the application and follow-up of the fatwa board’s directives and decisions as well as examination of contracts, agreements, and dealings made with clients, using a guide or manual developed in coordination with other relevant departments and endorsed by the Shari`ah board.\nSupreme Shar`i Supervisory Board\nThis is a board created mostly by the central bank to supervise all Islamic banks countrywide, in coordination with the Shar`i supervisory boards of banks.\nA new, growing type of Shar`i supervision of Islamic banks is Shar`i supervision and consultancy firms, which are independent of the financial institutions and the state banking system. A new trend that emerged only five years ago, such firms are largely concentrated in the GCC region.\nIt is noteworthy, in this respect, that there are juristic controversies still unresolved despite the many conferences and seminars, especially in Bahrain and Malaysia, which have introduced numerous standards. Yet, there is a unanimous agreement that Basic corporate activities must be free from the following:\n1. Usury (interests from loans or deposits, or transactions in which the principal money generates extra money with no goods or services transacted in between. This includes all usurious activities exercised by traditional financial institutions, such as commercial banks and corporations),\n2. Gambling,\n3. Production/promotion of alcohol or drugs,\n4. Serving of haram or unhealthy food such as pork,\n5. Provision of unlawful services such as establishing/managing immoral places, and\n6. Unreasonable risk, as in non-cooperative insurance, factoring, or trading on unpossessed assets (generally, transactions must be based on transparency and proportionate risk-sharing).\nBased on the above principles, Islamic banking introduces a number of profitable products, such as Musharakah, Mudarabah, Istisna`, Ijarah, Salam, etc., and suggests untraditional financing mechanisms that, understandably complex or old-fashioned though they may seem, guarantee safety of capital. Not always does risk work, and such Islamic mechanisms are based on real economy and real cash. They are recognized by experts as necessary curbs, amid feverish issuance of uncovered securities and slack regulatory control, which takes the funds to the unknown.\nConclusion\nThe Islamic finance model is worth trying, and France should employ it to join the club or even take the lead. We hope for a real partnership, not just a bubble that will soon be depleted with the GCC’s oil wells or melt away with the West’s cash liquidity like the snow coating the Pyrenees melts with the summer’s sun. We want it to be a lasting partnership of technological and commercial exchange as well as cultural and human interaction across the Mediterranean Sea.\nI call upon Western, and particularly French, researchers to enrich Islamic finance with studies and ideas and, together with Muslim jurists, to do their best to modernize and optimize Islamic institutions, using the best strategies in information technology, management, and accounting, to make them up-to-date institutions and investment vehicles for the good of all, while keeping their identity and distinct features.\nTo conclude with, Islamic economy can act as a vehicle that boosts international economy and a catalyst for rebuilding the capitalist economy, as demanded by France’s President Sarkozy. To that end, concerted efforts are required from everyone.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Ruling on Marriage Intended for Securing Some Benefit",
      "Answer": "\n I am a Mauritanian studying in Germany. I have the honor to ask you about the permissibility of marrying a Western Kitabi woman who claims to be Christian but does not abide by the teachings of her religion.\nAnd what is the ruling on marriage with the intention of divorce for the purpose of obtaining residency? Is this intention permissible?\nFirst, it is permissible to marry that German, who is considered Christian even if she believes that Jesus is a god. Allah, Exalted be He, calls them People of the Scripture, though He says,{Verily, they have disbelieved who say, “Indeed, Allah is the third of three”}. He also says,{Verily, they have disbelieved who say, “Indeed, Allah Himself is the Messiah, Son of Mary”}. Nevertheless, they were left to their beliefs and remained People of the Scripture. Accordingly, it is permissible to marry her. This is not a problem.\nSecond, marriage with the intention of divorce is valid, according to majority of Muslim scholars, such as Ash-Shatibi and Ibn Al-`Arabi, and this is the correct opinion in the Maliki school of jurisprudence. It is permissible to get married while intending to divorce. There is no problem with this, provided that this is not stated expressly in the marriage document.\nThird, there is no impediment to get married for the purpose of obtaining residency in Germany. A Prophetic hadith tells us that a woman is married for her wealth, her beauty, and her lineage. Here, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) mentioned other reasons than the basic reason for marriage, namely, to live together and have children. This is the concept of subsequent reasons or objectives, as Ash-Shatibi called them. In his Al-Muwafaqat,he said, “There is no impediment to get married for any of such subsequent reasons”. Obtaining residency is a subsequent reason, and although this subsequent reason has now become primary in importance, it remains permissible. Of course, there are resolutions by the European Council for Fatwa and Research disapproving this on the basis of weighing up the benefits and harms that may ensue. However, we say that the Shar`i ruling is that it is permissible to get married for the purpose of obtaining residency. A final point to note: The only problem with this is that it may give a bad impression of Muslims among Westerners. The woman thinks that she will live permanently with her husband, while the latter does not actually have this intention. So, we recommend that, if there is no necessity requiring otherwise, the marriage should be with the intention of continuity — but not perpetuity, as marriage in Islam is not perpetual like Christian marriage, as Ibn Al-`Arabi said — especially if the wife wishes to stay with him. This practice would distort the image of Islam and Muslims in the eyes of others, which is impermissible.\nTo conclude, there is no Shar`i impediment to marriage with the intention of divorce or for the purpose of obtaining residency. Only the last negative consequence highlighted above must be avoided.\nMay Allah grant us all success.\n\n\n Original Source Link \n",

We understand from this that they were permitted to carry out their traditions and customs, and since this matter does not involve a Shar`i misdeed, then there is no harm in doing it. For this reason, it is deemed permissible to beat drums in festivals and other events, based on the ruling that detestation, in some cases, does not utterly negate permissibility of the action. Hereupon, if this is a tradition and it is aimed to promote and benefit people, then the matter is flexible, Insha’ Allah, and there is no problem with it.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Ruling on Covering Face and Hands for Women",
      "Answer": "\nWhat is the Shar`i ruling on covering the face and hands for women?\nThe issue of covering the face and hands for women is controversial among Muslim scholars as well as among the Prophet’s Companions. Ibn Mas`ud held the view that this should be done, while `A’ishah (the Prophet’s wife) adopted the opposite view. Difference of opinion on this issue is based on the interpretation of the Verse: {Do not reveal their adornment except what appears thereof}. Some of the Companions deemed the face and hands objects of apparent adornment, while others said that the words “what appears thereof” refers to the outward appearance, i.e., the body seen after a woman has worn her clothes that cover her fully. After the Era of the Companions, scholars differed on the matter. The majority adopted the opinion that the face and hands are not `awrah (i.e., private body parts), such as Malik, Abu Hanifah, and Imam Ahmad (as one of the several judgments given by him in this respect). However, the opinion stated in these schools explains that uncovering the face and hands is only valid if the woman will not cause fitnah (i.e. temptation). But if fitnah is feared, scholars have two different opinions on whether it is permissible to uncover the face and hands. Some said that the man must lower his gaze, and the woman is not obligated to cover her face. This is the opinion of Al-Qadi `Iyad, who belongs to the Maliki school of thought, citing the hadith that tells the story of a woman from the tribe of Khath`am who came to the Prophet (PBUH) and he turned the face of Al-Fadl to the other side, but did not order her to cover her face. Many scholars opine that a woman should cover her face if fitnah is feared. The issue is controversial. The authentic opinion of Imam Ahmad indicates that a woman should cover her face and hands in the presence of strangers. In this regard, we advocate the opinion that a woman should cover her face and hands at places where the face and hands need to be covered, but at other places where this is not necessary, we commend a woman covers her head at least. In the end, this issue does not require much debate or disagreement. There are many other issues and duties more significant than such minor controversies.\nIn this relation, we urge Muslim preachers (may Allah reward them) to direct their efforts to useful channels and focus on vital issues of the Muslim Nation, seeking to cause unity, not discord. It is acceptable to differ on detailed points, especially if it is a controversy that has had some rationale since the time of the Prophet’s Companions, a controversy that relies on texts from the Qur’an and Sunnah, a controversy that originates from different interpretations. Those who advocate a controversial opinion should not be accused of weak faith or bad intentions. Instead, such an opinion should be recognized as respectable and acceptable, Insha’ Allah. We advise those who adopt controversial opinions to be aware of the grounds of controversy and not to accuse each other of infidelity or fabrication in the religion. The matter is flexible, and Allah has made for us no hardship in religion. He says, {And (Allah) has not laid upon you in religion any hardship}. For example, to order a woman in Europe to cover her face and hands, thus causing her trouble with the police or at airports, is something unallowable. Such kind of fatwas (legal opinions) is far from the insightful purposes of Shari`ah. In such a case, it would be better for her to stay in her own country if she wants to cover her face and hands, but if she travels to another country, covering her face and hands would cause a problem greater than that caused by uncovering her face and hands.

Actually, I can never feel easy about that. The problem is that most schools of medicine in Muslim countries are coed. Should we let our girls join such schools if there are no female-only alternatives? And what to do if we want female doctors for female patients as well as male doctors for male patients? Should we prevent girls from studying medicine if non-coed schools are not available or are distant from where they live?\nAll praise is due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah.\nDear questioner! Always seek perfection or, at least, near perfection. Answer to this question depends on the person and environment. If university systems are well designed to ensure safety and solemnity and to prevent male-female privacy and immorality in both student-student and student-teacher relationships, then there is no impediment to sending girls to such educational institutions, in view of the pressing need to have female nurses, obstetricians, and gynecologists.\nIf, otherwise, corruption is prevalent, it is a totally different case. What really matters in Shari`ah is the mainstream. If only a few number of disorderly incidents or students is reported at a given university, this should not raise much concern. As jurists maintain, prevalence outweighs infrequency. And Allah knows best.\n\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Ruling on Applying Man-Made Laws",
      "Answer": "\nWhat is the ruling of applying man-made laws? Can we charge the ruler who rules with man-made laws with disbelief?\nIn the name of Allah, the All-Merciful, the Mercy-giving. This issue is problematic and there has been much ado about it. In the past century fatwas were given in this regard. The issue should be dealt with in detail. First, it is undoubtedly prohibited and an enormous sin to rule with man-made laws, and there are Shari`ah texts contrary to implementing these laws. In the Quran we read, “And judge between them by what Allah has sent down. Nor are you to follow their whims.” [5:49] “Is it, then, the judgment of ignorance that they seek? Yet, who renders a fairer judgment than Allah to a people who have certainty?” [5:50] As for the charge of disbelief, this is something that cannot be definitely decided unless, along with ruling with these laws, there is explicit derision, degradation or belittling of the status of the Shari`ah. One says, for example, that the Shari`ah is not suitable to be applied, or similar words. But if one believes that the Shari`ah is true and everything else is not true, enacting such laws is not enough reason for the charge of disbelief, as it may be due to his inability, ignorance or imitation of others. Therefore, Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) said about the Quranic verse that reads, “And whoever does not rule by what Allah has sent down – then such as these are the non-muslims,” [5:44]  that this is a lesser disbelief, and about the verse that reads, ” And whoever does not rule by what Allah has sent down – then such as these are the ungodly,” [5:47] that this is a lesser ungodliness, which means that it does not cast the person out of the fold of the religion. This is the position we adopt based on many scholarly statements including statements from Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy with him). `Adyy ibn Hatem said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) reading from Bara’ah, “They have taken their rabbis and their monks as lords apart from Allah” [9:31] and he said, “They did not worship them, but if they made things lawful for them, they would deem it lawful, and if they made things unlawful for them, they would deem it unlawful.” [Reported by al-Termidhy (3095) and others] This is the indirect meaning of worshiping them. They changed the prescribed injunctions given in the name of the lawgiver insomuch that they declared as unlawful what the lawgiver made lawful and as lawful what the lawgiver made unlawful, attributing this to the Shari`ah, such as saying, for example, that the Prayer, Fasting or Zakah are not obligatory in the Shari`ah, or that committing enormous sins is permissible. But committing these enormous sins and letting others commit them is not a reason for disbelief, in itself. This position is contrary to the position of some muftis and sheikhs in the past century who considered merely doing this as enough reason for the charge of disbelief. We verified this point in a separate study titled (al-Takfeer bi al-Hukm bi Ghayr ma Anzala Allah) in the Contemporary Fiqh Research Magazine. Besides, the charge of disbelief will lead to wars and will stir devastating mischief. It is rather better to educate people and draw their attention to the importance of the Shari`ah and the great benefits the Shari`ah provides. Many of the Muslim countries were colonized and thus they inherited the laws of the colonizers and unconsciously continued in this way, lacking the courage to change these laws. Hence, we do not deem this as enough reason for the charge of disbelief unless it is accompanied by disparaging or deriding the Shari`ah, or by a deviant conviction. Peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Rights of Scholars in Islam",
      "Answer": "\nIn the name of Allah, the All-Merciful, the One Who gives Mercy. Peace be upon you. The mischievous practice of defamation has gone widespread among the youth. There is no scholar or student of knowledge but that they have disparaged and discredited him, though they claim to follow the approach of salafiyyah (adherence to the scholarly methodology of early pious Muslims). How can we deal with these pretenders who are disguised in the cloak of the salafiyyah and wrongly attribute themselves to it? Is there any comprehensive definition of salafiyyah? What is your opinion with regard to the approach of making a balance judgment?\nAll praise is due to Allah Alone. Peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah. And upon you be the peace, along with the mercy and blessings, of Allah. The question has several aspects. Thus, it will be more suitable to talk about them one by one: The first aspect is about defaming scholars. This is undeniably impermissible. Scholars, particularly practicing ones, are the best among the believers. Almighty Allah said “Those who malign the believing men and the believing women [by charging them] with [any wrongdoing] that they have not earned, all of these truly bear the burden of [committing both a grave] calumny and a clear sin.” [33:58]. They are believers and thus it is not permissible to hurt them or slander them. Such defamation is not appropriate; especially when it is done by young persons with little knowledge and a weak understanding. So, they should not defame scholars or monitor their words and acts until they reach such a level of knowledge and insight that allow them to distinguish the good from the evil, the sheep from the goat, and right from wrong. The way to deal with these people is to educate them and ask them to study fiqh and to learn. If man does not equip himself with fiqh, he will wander blindly. Thus, I advise all our brothers and youth to seek knowledge, because there is no alternative to knowledge. When you learn, you will know the truth. Ali, the commander of the believer, (may Allah have mercy with him) said “Know men through the truth but never know the truth through men.” This is what he said when a man said to him, “Do you believe that Talha and Al-Zubayr  were wrong?” To which he also replied, “You are a man who  is confused.” Ignorance is the reason. One needs to learn the Quran, the Sunnah, scholarly difference of opinions, controversial issues, and issues that have gained consensus. Then he becomes insightful and becomes able to distinguish the truth from a lie, or realize that all opinions are acceptable. Many of the differences of opinions among scholars are praiseworthy, as the erudite scholar Ibn al-Qayyim said. Difference of opinions is one of the laws of life. We need to be broad minded. We should teach them fiqh and the reasons of scholars’ difference of opinions, hoping that they become insightful and cure their ignorance and, at sometimes, extremism. The second aspect is related to Salafiyyah. Salafiyyah is a term that denotes referring to the salaf. Of course, as far as I know, there is no comprehensive and agreed upon definition. We, rather, can say that salafiyyah is an ideology or a school of thought and creed that adopts adherence to the methodology of the salaf with regard to negating any allegorical interpretation of the divine Attributes, sticking to the texts of the Quran and the Sunnah, and avoiding innovative religious practices. These are approximately the broad lines of salafiyyah, without delving into such details that may lead to controversial issues. Thus, a salafi person avoids innovative religious practices, denying the classification of innovative religious practices into good and bad forms. He rather deems all innovative religious practices as bad. This school also rejects any allegorical interpretation with regard to the divine Attributes found in the texts of the Quran and the Sunnah. It disallows discussing them and deals with them as they are (without delving into them), as reported from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy with him). But there is a variance inside the school between those who strictly stick to the apparent meanings and those who adopt a less strict attitude. These, in general, are the broad lines. The third aspect is about making balanced judgments, which has its origin in the Book of Allah. Almighty Allah says “They ask you about intoxicants and gambling. Say: In both of them there is a great sin and some benefit for people. Yet their sin is greater than their benefit.” [2:219] This is a basis for balancing between any benefits and harms, sins and profits. On this basis, scholars have established how to balance between different harms, telling us to take the lesser of two evils, the lesser of two harms, the lesser of two prohibitions, or the lesser of two undesirable acts. Ibn Taymiyyah said, “If there is no other way, the lesser of two undesirable acts or the lesser of two evils should be given precedence.” Ibn al-Qayyim gave a lengthy discussion on this point and so did al-Shatibi in al-Muwafaqat. Scholars do not differ over this rule, though they may differ over its finer details and examples of it. Therefore, the presence of benefits and harms in a situation is inevitable. There is nothing in this life but it has benefits and also harms. Al-Shatibi said “There is no benefit in this world that is totally harmless.” He means people’s customs and transactions. There is also no harm that is totally profitless. However, consideration is given to the preponderating aspect, be it the benefit or the harm, the sin or the profit, as indicated by the noble verse. Thus, making balanced judgments is valuable and no jurist can have a subtle understanding of fiqh unless he knows that there are different levels for prohibited matters. These are the words of al-Shatibi (may Allah have mercy with him). There are also different levels for obligations. Some obligations can be neglected for some benefit. Some prohibitions can be neglected for another benefit. There are many examples of this, such as abstaining from rebelling against rulers, even if they are unjust and wrongdoers. This is the position of ahl al-Sunnah (those who adhere to the Sunnah) (may Allah have mercy with them). Why is this so? It is so because this will lead to harmful consequences. We cannot take into consideration any benefit if its harm could be more preponderant. There is what is called the negligible benefits, which should not be taken into consideration. Benefits are either considerable or negligible; and such consideration of benefits differs. There are three different suitable attributes considered in the shari`ah text; the effective suitable attributes, the appropriate suitable attributes, and the unrestricted suitable attributes, which the shari`ah attests neither to its suitability to be considered nor to its negligibility.These are the balancing criteria with regard to what are called the suitable attributes, which are based on the consideration of any benefits; namely, the ruling that is when it is built on the attribute a benefit of the same kind of the benefits that the lawgiver cares for their achievement ensues or a harm of the same kinds of the harms that the lawgiver cares for their avoidance ensues. This is a lengthy discussion for which one needs to review the books of the scholars of usul al-fiqh (the principles of Islamic jurisprudence) along with the chapter we wrote on the unrestricted public interest. Allah knows best.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Ruling on a Fasting Person with a Chronic Disease",
      "Answer": "\nWhat about temporary and chronic sickness regarding fasting and what is the ruling of the sick person in both cases? May Allah bless you.\nIn the case of chronic sickness, one ought to give the compensation of feeding. He neither has to fast, nor to make up the fasting, nor to attempt to fast to know whether he will be able to continue or not, for his sickness thus may grow severe. But with regard to temporary sickness, one does not give compensation but waits until he gains recovery to make up the fasting. This is the difference between the two cases: the ruling of the first case is to give the compensation of feeding while the ruling of the other is to wait until he can make it up after recovery.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Republishing Effaced Caricatures Mocking Our Prophet",
      "Answer": "\nI am a journalist for an English-speaking newspaper, and I made a full report on the wave of anger that prevailed across the Islamic World on the Danish cartoons drawn by the enemies of Islam that blaspheme Prophet Muhammad, the master of all humanity (PBUH). I also published statements by prominent orientalists, Westerners and international leaders expressing their great admiration and praise of Allah’s Messenger. I picked out three of the notorious Danish cartoons, minimized and with a big X mark covering most of the pictures. The frame size was about 7×9 cm, published in a large page format. Republication of this disparagingly X-marked miniature was a response to the insults that the cartoonists tried to use against the impeccable Messenger. But unfortunately, I was accused of blasphemy and was detained for 12 days. Now, I have been taken to the court, and I do not know what Allah has destined me for! Is what I did punishable? Or is it permissible on the grounds that it was meant to retort, not to support, the insult?\nAll praise is due to Allah, and peace and prayer be upon the Messenger of Allah. We advise the questioner to avoid all situations that are doubtful, as stressed by the hadith: “Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt” [Narrated by At-Tirmidhi (2518) and others]. By publishing these cartoons, you have exposed yourself to accusations and brought upon yourself needless trouble. Such cartoons irritate and hurt Muslims all over the world, then why did you publish them again?! Even if it was with good intentions, and we should believe that the publication was with good intentions, you should not have published them in the first place. You know that Muslims have been extremely angered by such cartoons, which mock the master of all creation and the one beloved by Allah, Prophet Muhammad, so why would you republish them? You have said that you republished them to defend the Prophet. But, to truly defend the Prophet, you should publish anything else, but not such very cartoons. It was good to publish statements by major orientalists praising the Prophet. In general, I think that the court could believe your argument and accept your excuse and regret for publishing them, and you should never do so again. A final advice: you should not seek help from the enemies of Islam against your fellow Muslims. Even if the court rules against you, do not resort to non-Muslims; otherwise, you will be a hypocrite. Keep patient with your own people, even if you believe that the decision is unfair. When the Prophet decided to punish Ka`b Ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) by not speaking with him, the king of Ghassan (who was a Christian) sent him a letter offering him asylum. Steadfast in his faith, Ka`b threw the letter into the fire, saying, “Even those people wish that [i.e., the renunciation of Islam] from me?!” Afterwards, Allah accepted his repentance. The point is to hold fast to your faith, even if you see that the court’s decision is wrong and that you only sincerely wanted to defend the Prophet but your action was misunderstood. You chose a wrong way, as republishing the cartoons, even if marked with an X, may imply an interest in promoting them and might cause readers to buy the foreign newspaper that first published them, which opens the door to accusations. Anyway, you should deal with this crisis firmly and declare expressly that your intention was good and that if it was misunderstood then you repent to Allah, seek forgiveness from Him, and invoke blessings on His Prophet.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Reference Unification Minimizes Fatwa Conflict",
      "Answer": "\nVice-Chairman of the International Union for Muslim Scholars (IUMS), prominent scholar Sheikh Abdullah Bin Bayyah, emphasized the importance of having references to limit conflict of fatwas and opinions, confirming at the same time that such references need more effort and organization to be able to protect People of Sunnah by confuting their beliefs and convictions that contradict with the Shar`i sources, i.e., the Glorious Qur’an and the Prophetic Sunnah. In an interview with “Ad-Din Wa Al-Hayah” (Religion & Life), the Sheikh said that People of Sunnah have unified references and sources, such as the International Islamic Fiqh Academy, the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League (MWL), and the IUMS. He discussed several issues of concern for Muslims these days. Here is the script of the interview:\nInterviewer: Some argue that there should be a Sunni reference. What do you think?\nBin Bayyah: People of Sunnah already have references, which are derived from unified but diverse sources. Thanks Allah, now we have the International Islamic Fiqh Academy, which serves as a reference for all Muslims, as well as MWL’s Islamic Fiqh Council, the Grand Ulema Commission, and the IUMS. Unification of references is important to minimize conflict of fatwas and opinions. However, they still need much effort and mobilization to protect People of Sunnah against any beliefs or views that contradict with the Sunni sources, i.e., the Qur’an and Sunnah. We can deal with all differences without having to initiate clashes or wars against others and while keeping fundamentals and characteristics that cannot be negotiated.\nFatwa Industry\nInterviewers: What do you mean by fatwa industry?\nBin Bayyah: I coined this term with the purpose of drawing scholars’ as well as questioners’ attention to the fact that fatwa is not that simple. It is a highly sophisticated process that requires certain scholarly skills and techniques. No one who is unqualified or unpossessed of such skills should engage in fatwa giving; rather, they should seek information from specialists and experts — here, they are religious scholars. Allah says, {So, ask (about anything) the people of knowledge (of that specific thing) if you do not know}. This is the wisdom behind choosing this concept as a title for one of my works.\nScrutinizing Religious Texts\nInterviewer: There are some who ignore religious texts on the pretext that there are implied Shar`i objectives. What do you think?\nBin Bayyah: This falls under the fatwa industry mentioned earlier. The relation between overall objectives and detailed texts is so solid. Objectives come from scrutiny of texts, and as such they are Shar`i objectives derived from Shar`i texts — thus, both Shari`ah and objectives are not separate and cannot be seen as contradictory with each other. This delicate notion can be understood only by knowledgeable scholars who are aware of detailed texts and their applications, the holistic objectives and their applications, and the text-objective dialectic and its implications. The soundest methodology is to consider objectives and texts. A true scholar is one who keeps an eye on detailed texts and the other eye on ultimate objectives. To look only at explicit texts is imprudent and incompatible with the example of the Companions of Prophet Muhammad (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him). Likewise, being satisfied exclusively with objectives at the expense of relevant texts is a departure from the doctrines of early Muslim scholars. Both objectives and texts should be kept in mind and approached in the very ways that scholars have come up with in Fundamentals of Fiqh, which is a body of criteria for deduction and finding common grounds between both wings.\nFundamentals of Fiqh\nInterviewer: You have just said that Fundamentals of Fiqh is a body of criteria for deduction and finding common grounds between Shar`i objectives and detailed texts. Some claim that Fundamentals of Fiqh techniques are no longer sufficient and that we need to renew Fundamentals of Fiqh. How do you comment?\nBin Bayyah: Such claims really do exist, and we need to have a closer look at them. Those who advocate renewing Fundamentals of Fiqh could not perceive the broader picture of this discipline. They need first to explore Fundamentals of Fiqh as left by early Muslim scholars, from Ash-Shafi`i to Ash-Shatibi, to see its great potential for deduction of rulings (including but not limited to word-level and context-level denotations, analogy, juristic preference, unrestricted public interests, blocking means leading to sins, customs, and other major and comprehensive techniques) that, if used well, can provide solutions to all new issues. Then, if such advocates find any deficiency, let them proceed and introduce effective substitutes. It is unacceptable to hold ill-founded or empty claims that only serve to divert us from the tested-and-proven deductive tools and techniques we already have to nothing that can be used instead.\nFatwas and Standards\nInterviewer: Do you think there should be standards to govern those who provide fatwas on satellite channels?\nBin Bayyah: Yes. This issue has been addressed by many conferences, specifically the Ifta’ Conference held in Kuwait. It is necessary to define standards and criteria to prevent unauthorized or unreliable fatwas, especially in major issues such as jihad, judgment of disbelief, and other issues of concern for the Ummah. It is not enough to know about Shar`i objectives and reality to be eligible for absolute freedom to give fatwa. One thing a Faqih should be fully aware of is the text-reality dialectic. In addition, there are issues related to Islamic business and economy that not everyone has enough knowledge of. There remain small issues pertinent to acts of worship and ordinary human dealings that a competent Faqih can give fatwas on. Not all issues are equal, according to Ash-Shatibi, nor are they at the same level. Some issues are so critical or sensitive that they should not be handled by those with inadequate expertise. There are issues whose solutions can be found in books regardless of reality, since they have a permanent nature that does not change from one time or place to another. Such kind of issues can be tackled by any erudite Faqih.\nInterviewer: Some argue that this is a time of special permissions and not of strict abidance by rules.\nBin Bayyah: Managing matters of religious special permissions and strict rules is one of the basics of Shari`ah. The Islamic Shari`ah has been revealed by Allah, the All-Wise, the Ever-Praiseworthy, and it has been set down in Allah’s Divine Knowledge that the human being is weak and fretful — Allah says, {Fretful when evil touches him}.\nNaturally, human circumstances and conditions require both strict rules and exceptions, as people alternate between health and ailment, youth and senility, affluence and insolvency, etc. Shari`ah has taken all such variations into account and made necessary arrangements for every possibility, and so it stands as the Shari`ah of Fitrah (i.e., natural disposition), the Fitrah that Allah has created in humankind. It is by nature to alternate between strict rules and exceptional permissions; who adheres to Shar`i rules can enjoy exceptions in case of emergency, but who rejects Shar`i rules and obligations will not be taken into consideration at all.\nTherefore, it cannot be said that our present time is not suitable for full enforcement of Shar`i rules. Well-established rules are still applicable and enforceable, within their own limits, and exceptions are available for cases of necessity. This is the norm of things\nDialogue with the West\nInterviewer: You have launched a Global Center for Renewal and Guidance, located in London. What role does it play?\nBin Bayyah: As the name suggests, the center is designed for renewal and guidance; it seeks to re-understand issues facing Muslims. Renewal is not an act of innovation, but rather of renovation. It is an attempt to renew what have been obliterated, due perhaps to lack of understanding. It links (1) Shar`i texts with Shar`i objectives and (2) Shar`i texts and objectives with reality. Through this dynamic linkage, we can modernize our understanding of different issues and realize Shari`ah’s great flexibility and potential, not only for spirituality but for life affairs too. Economic practices, coexistence, and acceptance of the “other” are just examples of issues that need renewed approaches. Guidance, on the other side, is meant to teach Western Muslims basics of good conduct and sound beliefs. To that end, the center runs courses for intellectuals, center leaders, and imams to gird them with refined knowledge in arenas of thought, Fiqh, and Shari`ah; answer their queries; and engage them in lively discussions in which they exchange ideas in an enriching give-and-take process. Interaction is crucial among Muslims in Western countries and even in Muslim-dominated areas, since we are living, as it is always held, in a small village where no nation can be isolated from what is going on in other parts of today’s world. Thus, the Fiqhi discipline that is dubbed Fiqh of Minorities may as well be needed by some majorities in their lived reality, as everyone inevitably would sometimes have unusual cases that need special exceptions from mainstream rulings.\nDialogue Is a Shar`i Requirement\nInterviewer: You are one of the advocates of dialogue with the West. But with whom in the West: Politicians, Nations, or Clerics?\nBin Bayyah: There is no problem to hold dialogue with politicians, clerics, intellectuals, or nations in general. First, dialogue is a Shar`i requirement, and our religion has nothing that falls in disharmony with Fitrah or reason; it is a religion of physical and mental evidence. In his interpretation of the Qur’anic verse: {And the religion of truth, so that He may cause it to prevail over all (false) religion}, Al-Hafiz Ibn Al-`Arabi wrote that Islam has spread through logical argument and spiritual conviction, not by means of force or warfare.\nNowadays as Islam and Muslims are stigmatized and charged with terrorism, a phobia fabricated by neoconservatives to destroy the world on the pretext of the so-called reorganization of the world and the Greater Middle East, we feel a stressing need to confute such allegations and show how our religion is one of peace and justice and how the “other” lacks sound logic and good intentions. In fact, some Muslims commit mistakes that those opponents utilize to justify their prejudices and rally more nations against Islam. But they have not been, and will never be, able to make their schemes a reality. In their own homes, neoconservatives are now suffering serious economic and security troubles. At the same time, we are to introduce our true image and put our religion in its rightful position for the benefit of all humankind. Islam in its very core is a mercy to all that exists.\nIslamic Economics\nInterviewer: Why have Muslim scholars not introduced Islamic economics to the world as a solution to the global financial crisis?\nBin Bayyah: It seems we have not presented it well enough. Existing models of Islamic banks and Shari`ah-compliant financial products have actually played some role, which is not bad, but there is much more they can contribute. Global economy is hammered by a slew of ailments, some technical and some in the underlying philosophy itself. For both categories, Islam has excellent solutions. In the global economic mentality, laissez faire et laissez passer(“let do and let pass”) constitutes the key maxim in business. It implies removal of all restrictions on trade and freedom from state intervention, placing the individual in the center of the whole economic structure. By contrast, Islamic Shari`ah derives its reference from Allah, Exalted be He, based on the concept of trusteeship. Allah says, {And spend of that whereof He (i.e., Allah) has made you trustees}. As a trustee or agent, man does not have absolute freedom, but should rather act within the framework of ensuring good and warding off evil. In the aftermath of 1929′s Great Depression, restrictions were imposed to regulate economy. With the advent of Thatcherism and Reaganism, economic deregulation and promotion of “individual initiative” started, inspired by the pioneering economic philosopher Adam Smith’s theory of the “invisible hand of the market”, which states that the marketplace has a self-regulating nature, by virtue of an invisible and benevolent hand. All that entire system is now shown up to be a total failure. On the other hand, Islamic economics does encourage self-initiative and self-freedom, but within limits and guidelines that adjust the course of economy.\nIn terms of practical application, we find that only 5 percent of global economy is based on real investment, while the remaining is mere venturing, prediction, and unreal wealth. On the contrary, Islamic economy adopts the principle of exchanging wealth within society at large and not monopolizing it by the wealthy. Allah says, {That you exchange among yourselves}.Exchange is to be only of real wealth. In an authentic hadith, the Prophet (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Sell the less-quality dates for (a sum of) dirhams, and then buy with the dirhams good dates”. Money is just a means. We have principles of exchange, or circulation as Ibn `Ashur puts it, and transparency. They have made huge profits from usury, while it is utterly prohibited in Islam to exchange money for money. Even in the West itself, there are voices that speak up against usury. Islam warns that the consequences of usury are dreadful: {But if you do not do (i.e., do not give up usury), then let it be a war (against you) from Allah and His Messenger}.\nBy the same token, they practice factoring, while Islam bans selling a debt for another, according to the hadith narrated by Al-Bazzar.\nRelations with Shiites\nInterviewer: Is there a chance of convergence between Sunnites and Shiites?\nBin Bayyah: Such convergence is difficult due to disunity in sources. We believe in the Prophetic biography and legacy as documented in Sunnah books, and we have our own way of interpreting it. We derive our knowledge of the Prophet’s Sunnah from his Companions and family members, and we never find contradiction between love for his family and love for and modeling after his Companions. Difference about sources makes inter-sect concurrence a complicated pursuit. Regardless of such considerations, we call for regulation of such difference to avoid collision. The common ground or umbrella that we all share is “La ilaha illa Allah Muhammad rasul Allah (i.e., There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah)” — at the same time, we cannot ignore the differences or allow them to ignite conflicts and disaccord. There is no worship to be served by mutual revilement or censure.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Reciting Surah Al-Fatihah in Meetings",
      "Answer": "\nWhat is the ruling of reading Al-Fatihah before the beginning of public meetings? I hope you give the details and show the evidence so that we can have the Shari`ah proof.\nAnd upon you be peace together with the mercy and blessings of Allah. Reading the Quran is absolutely commendable but not in a specific place or time. Almighty Allah said, “Read of the Quran, so much as may be easy [for you]” and “Read of it, so much as may be easy [for you]” [73:20] Hence, reading the Quran has a great reward because Almighty Allah gives you ten rewards for each letter, “I do not say that Alif Laam Meem is one letter, but Alif is one letter, Laam is one letter, and Meem is one letter” as the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said. [Reported by al-Termidhy (2910) on the authority of Ibn Mas`oud (may Allah be pleased with him)] In the hadith reported by al-Termidhy (2926) on the authority of Abu Sa`eed al-Khudry (may Allah pleased with him) the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “He who keeps himself busy with the Quran and with My remembrance, I shall give him better than what I give to those who ask Me.” Thus, reading the Quran is one of the virtuous and recommendable deeds. As for doing this before, after, or during meetings, there is no specific text in this regard. So, if a person does this believing that it is a sunnah or something obligatory, he will thus be contravening the Shari`ah. But if he reads it to seek the blessings of the Quran, there will be nothing wrong with this, insha’ Allah, according to the correct position we choose. The issue is based on the difference of opinion concerning what is called additional bid`ah (innovative religious practices). Many of the Malikites dislike the additional bid`ah, while, according to some other scholars, the issue pertains to the general rule. Thus, they are included under the evidence of general permissibility or recommendation, as viewed by the Safi`ites as well as al-`Izz ibn `Abd al-Salam and al-Qarafy from among the Malikites. Hence, there is nothing wrong with this issue; in the sense that there should be no disagreement between Muslims regarding it, “Never harbor hatred to one another, never harbor envy to one another, never turn your backs on one another…” [Reported by al-Bukhary (6065) and Muslim (2559) on the authority of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him)] Therefore, whoever wants to read al-Fatihah, we should not prevent him. But none should say that this is from the sunnah or that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) used to begin with it, for this is not correct. Nevertheless, if you read al-Fatihah to seek blessings from it and to seek reward from Allah, there will be nothing wrong with this, insha’ Allah.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Reason &#038; Rationalism",
      "Answer": "\nAmid such heated argument about rationalism and reason, with some for, some against, and some criticizing Muslim lack of it (as seen in the last speech of the Pope), it is relevant to have a look at such concepts in terms of their meaning, importance, and limits.\nIn the Western perception, reason (from Old French raison, from Latin ratio) can simply be defined as a “human capacity for logical, rational, and analytic thought”. It is the tool that directs the “inner world”, turns feelings into decisions, and motivates action. It is a body of principles and ways of thinking that enable good judgment on things. It is abstract (just like good and evil), not material or sensible (such as blackness, dates, wheat, etc.).\nMeanwhile, rationalism is “any view appealing to reason as a source of knowledge or justification”. Some Western philosophers hold that reason or the mind is independent of experience, whether absolute, as maintained by Descartes (adopting a Platonic perspective), or critical, as proposed by Kant. Rationalism opposes eighteenth-century British empiricism, with primary exponents like John Locke and Hume.\nAs back as the second century A.H. (eighth century A.D.), Muslim thinkers tried to resolve such dichotomy between reason and rationalism, but often to no avail. Ash-Shafi`i defined reason as the “capacity to distinguish things from their opposites”. Others said, “Reason is an instinct that is subject to humanities”. Al-Amidi said, “It is all the necessary knowledge that cannot be absent in any human when physically mature, sound, and free from the contraries”. This is the same view of Descartes.\nAccording to Al-Ghazali, reason is instinctive and necessary and is classified into theoretical and empirical. Is reason the same for all people and unvarying from one person/nation to another?\n‘Yes’ was the answer given to the above question by Ar-Razi, Ibn Al-Qushayri, and others, including Descartes, who held that “good sense is of all things in the world the most equally distributed”. Some, on the other hand, deemed reason empirical and interpersonally varying. Reconciliation could be made between the two sides, identifying two types of the so-called reason, instinctive and empirical, regardless of real or figurative usage, on the grounds that reason and good sense increase and decrease depending on experiences.\nDoes the mind have limits?\nSome Western philosophers view that the mind have no limits, and some go far to claim that the mind has only the limits that it makes for itself or that all that can be perceived is within the limits of the mind. In his remarkable work Critique of Pure Reason, Kant discussed in detail the scope and limits of reason.\nBy contrast, some admitted that the human intellect is limited by its physical and social surroundings, which impose on it constraints that show its limitation. Perhaps this is what the contemporary Moroccan philosopher Taha Abdurrahman meant by warning against reason by reason for reason. For us Muslims and all believers in a heavenly message, reason has a ceiling or utmost point, which is where the sphere of heavenly revelation exists as a metaphysical realm beyond the perception of the human mind. Yet, the mind deals with this sphere in terms of mental impossibility, possibility, and inevitability. As Muslims, we believe that scope cannot involve contradiction. What is deemed impossible by reason cannot be deemed possible by heavenly revelation, and what is deemed inevitable by reason must be deemed so by heavenly revelation.\nThe possible can be approved or denied by heavenly revelation, where the latter makes judgments without objection by reason, which has to do with impossibility and inevitability but submits to heavenly revelation in connection with possibility. This applies to the field of Creed, where reason is a generative source or determinant. In Shari`ah, however, two spheres must be identified. The first is dealings, which are based on people’s interests and where reason goes side by side with heavenly revelation. Scholars differed on this integration: Some saw that if Shari`ah is established on a specific case, it has precedence over people’s interests necessitated by reason; others viewed that Shari`ah authorizes the mind to use interests as a basis for legislation. But there is a general agreement that reason remains an indispensable exploring tool.\nThe second sphere is acts of worship, which basically come from heavenly revelation and are beyond the scope of the mind. Still, as Al-Fihri said, such acts of worship are rational in general, even if not comprehensible in details, such as Prayer, etc.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Question on the Friday Khutbah",
      "Answer": "\nThe Question:\n“Is allowable for me to pray behind an Imam who reads the second khutbah in a language other than Arabic?”\nThe Answer:\nThe origin is that the Friday sermon is conducted in the Arabic Language, and this is the opinion of the majority of the scholars. However, Abu Hanifa, may Allah have mercy upon him, allowed for the sermon to be given in a language other than Arabic. Therefore, there is nothing to stop one from praying with this Imam particularly if the people of that country do not [speak/understand] Arabic. However, we advice this Imam to, at a minimum, mention a few words in Arabic during the Friday sermon such as, remember Allah and seek Allah’s pardon. These [Arabic phrases] will allow him to avoid falling into a disliked act, the differences and the doubts that surround this issue. We ask Allah to guide you and us.\nDr. Abdullah bin Bayyah\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "On the Regulations of the Scientific Miracle of the Qur’an",
      "Answer": "\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most-Merciful\nAll praise is due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon our master, Muhammad, and upon his family and Companions.\nI bear witness that there is no deity but Allah, Who has no partner. This is a testimony by a person who has no evidence on any other god: {And whoever invokes besides Allah another deity for which he has no proof then his account is only with his Lord}. It is a testimony by a person who has seen proofs of His Divinity in the perfect and wonderful creation of the universe, as evident by hearing, sight, and perception, as well as the signs and verses sent with His Messengers to be realized by perceptual faculties and by reason and heart.\nAnd I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, the Seal of Prophets and the ascender to the heavens in an event that gives evidence on the inevitable existence of the Almighty Creator.\nI bear witness that if You, my Lord, give my rein to myself, You will be leaving me to weakness, imperfection, sinfulness, and utter misguidance. It is You Who we worship, by Your Grace, and it is You to Whom we resort, by Your Blessing, to enable us to fulfill the duties of such a blessed testimony in the realms of reason, heart, and perception. O Allah! Help us fulfill it and hold on to it until we meet You. We humbly pray to You, with a tongue that expresses our weakness and inability and Your Power and Encompassment of everything, that You may enable us to fulfill the requirements of the testimony that there is no deity but Allah and that Muhammad is the Allah’s Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him), in all faith, goodness, and submission to Your Ordinances and Prohibitions, and in adherence to the Sunnah of Your Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him).\nScientific miraculousness of the Qur’an is a discipline that focuses on newly discovered scientific facts that humanity had never before been able to discover and that come to agree with some statements in the Qur’an or Prophetic Sunnah.\nDear brothers!\nToday, we will discuss the connection between Allah’s Words in the Qur’an and the sings and laws found in this universe, as perceived by human senses, reason, or both.\nReligion Vs. Science\nAs you already know, this blessed religion, with which Allah concluded the Heavenly Revelation, has faced many challenges, overcome many hardships, and refuted many falsehoods.\nOne challenge faced by this religion is extermination and expulsion of its followers. Allah says,{And verily, they were about to frighten you so much as to drive you out from the land. But, in that case, they would not have stayed (therein) after you except for a little while}[Al-Isra’: 76].\nThis verse was revealed when the Prophet was still in Mecca. And it was just 15 months after expelling him that the expellers went out to fight him in the Battle of Badr, in which they were crushingly defeated. In At-Tahrir Wa At-Tanwir (Liberation and Enlightenment), it is stated, “That verse predicted that the Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) would be expelled from Mecca and that his expellers would stay in Mecca only for a short time thereafter”.\nFor its enemies, eradication of this religion altogether has always been a big dream. But Allah has aligned for it dedicated followers who, supported by His Help and Power, managed in less than a century to expand geographically as considerably as from China to the Pyrenees, thus guaranteeing it a never-ending existence.\nAnother challenge comes from other heavenly as well as earthly religions. With its pure monotheism, just legislation, and full equality, Islam argues with other religions and faiths in the fairest manner, using clear proofs and undeniable arguments. The Trinity has been proved incoherent, and clergymen of other religions have been flabbergasted before the light of Islamic Prophethood and perfection of Revelation. Since the advent of Islam, there have been many clergymen who, with Allah’s Guidance, embraced Islam and many who fought against it, both ideologically and militarily. In response, many preeminent Muslim scholars stood to defend Islam against such allegations, such as Ibn Hazm, Ibn Taymiyyah, and Ash-Shahrstani.\nThe third challenge is the Western philosophies, particularly ancient Greek philosophy, which had spoiled Christianity with blasphemous and atheistic views. Equipped with irrefragable Revelation and sound reasoning, Muslim scholars acted to debunk such fallacies, remarkably Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali, Ibn Taymiyyah, and Ibn Rushd (Averroes). Despite their differences, they all armed themselves with the light of pure Revelation to stand firmly against the fatally erroneous theories of philosophy and approve its positive contributions, in a uniquely constructive give-and-take. Objective Western philosophers have benefited much from Islamic philosophy, and the true religion has overpowered all its opponents by virtue of compelling argument, not the sword, as stated by the Andalusian scholar Abu Bakr Ibn Al-`Arabi.\nOne more challenge posed to Islam and all traditional religions is the modern age of technology and scientific materialism, whose “dark side” is having more and more influence on the minds of new generations, sadly to the detriment of emotions and values. How to regain touch with morality in our lives, which is the safety valve for us as humans? Without doubt, with such weapons and technologies at hand, if man is detached from his sense of humanity, he will become more like a brainless, self-destructive beast.\nAllah’s Words have always retorted to challenges in the fields of legislation, education, spirituality, etc. But now, modern science has come out with further evidence from the physical world on the truthfulness of Revelation. “The magic has backfired on the magician”, as the Arabic saying goes. The adversaries who wished to use science as a decisive weapon against religion have been given a taste of their own medicine, as unprecedented scientific demonstrations were found within the texts of the Qur’an and Sunnah.\nMany figures of modern science are acknowledging that the religious texts of Islam are not like any other religious texts, whereto alterations and modifications have been made that are incompatible with modern science. Only the Munificent Qur’an, as argued by Maurice Bucaille, a French medical doctor, contains no statements contradicting established scientific fact, compared to numerous disagreements and repetitions in other scriptures. As we believe, the Qur’an is the only scripture divinely protected intact, which stands as evidence of its divine origin and the truthfulness of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him).\nBefore discussing the scientific miracle in some detail, let’s first define some relevant terms:\nMiracle is an event that appears inexplicable by the laws of nature and so is held to be supernatural in origin or an act of God.\nEvidence is thing or things helpful in forming a conclusion or judgment.\nVerse is one of the numbered subdivisions of a chapter in the Qur’an. Also, in Arabic, it is synonymous to the word “sign”.\nSign is something that suggests the presence or existence of a fact, condition, or quality.\nAccording to Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar, a sign is more generic than a miracle or supernatural power. He explained that some sings are meant to challenge opponents, while others serve only to prove truthfulness. That is, every miracle is by extension a sign, but not every sign is necessarily a miracle.\nIbn Khaldun, in the introduction to Tarikh Al-`Ibar (The History of Indicative Lessons), wrote, “Other signs of them (i.e., Prophets) include doing supernatural things that corroborate their claim. Such things are totally beyond human capacity.… Thus, a miracle combines an extraordinary event and challenge”.\nDescribing the revelation of the Qur’an unto an illiterate Prophet, Allah says, {And neither have you ever recited any book before it (i.e., the Qur’an) nor transcribed one with your right hand. Then, the falsifiers would have had a reason to doubt. Rather, it contains self-evident verses (preserved) in the hearts of those who have been granted knowledge}.\nIn another part of the Qur’an, the word “sign” is used to imply “evidence”. Talking about the recognition by the People of the Scripture of the Glorious Qur’an based on statements found in their scriptures, Allah says, {Is it not a sign for them that the learned among the Children of Israel recognized it? Yet, had We sent it down unto one of the non-Arabs such that he could recite it to them, they still would have never believed in it}.\nHence, the Qur’an consists of clear verses and sings and is the Prophet’s greatest miracle that will last till the end of time, bringing for the people of every time what may guide them to believe in God, depending on Allah’s predestination for them whether to be guided or not. The Prophet said, “No Prophet but was given such signs that would drive people to believe. However, what I have been given is but a revelation revealed by Allah, and I hope that I will have the greatest number of followers on the Day of Resurrection” (Reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim).\nThe hadith indicates the perpetuity of the last Message, which enables it to attract followers forever. It is a main feature that distinguishes the Qur’an from all the numerous miracles of the Prophet and other Prophets as well. Such miracles were known by direct witnessing for those who attended the events and by telling for whosoever else. We came to know about incidents like, say, the Prophet’s chest opening or the splitting of the moon through reports in the Qur’an and/or Sunnah. Such were miracles that just happened and gone.\nAs for the Glorious Qur’an, it bears the true Testimony of Allah, Exalted be He, and His unmistakable clarification for all people. It is a declaration conveyed to everyone, everywhere and at every time: {This (Qur’an) is a declaration for all people}; {And this Qur’an has been revealed to me (as a means) with which to forewarn you and whomever it reaches}.The Qur’an is a message and a witness, a premise and a conclusion, a claim and a proof. It is kept unchanged with a pledge by the Creator, to substantiate its authenticity. Evidence, signs, verses, and miracles, all are closely related features of the tree of Prophethood, which has no human match.\nThe Islamic Message is like a delightful, fruitful, evergreen tree that every beholder will perceive just one aspect of its splendor, beauty, and perfection. Some embraced Islam because they were impressed by the person of the Prophet. `Abdullah Ibn Salam said, “When I saw the Prophet’s face, I said this could not be the face of a liar, and I immediately entered Islam”. In another hadith, Ar-Rubyyi` Bint Mu`awwidh (may Allah be pleased with her) said, “When I saw him, I would say that the sun was shining”.\nOthers went beyond appearance to reflection, as indicated in a hadith by Salman (may Allah be pleased with him). A third group challenged the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) to perform them perceivable miracles — such as when Quraysh asked him to split the moon and it was split in twain that the Mount Hira was visible between the two parts (as authentically reported), or when a man of the tribe of Sulaym asked him to resurrect a dead lizard and then Allah raised it from the dead at the Prophet’s hands and made it testify to his Prophethood. Other miracles of that kind include the testimony to his Prophethood by the trees and stones, the moaning of a tree trunk in front of many Companions because the Prophet stopped using it, the blessing of little amounts of food and drink to become sufficient for many people (as reported in many hadiths with semi-reliable chain of narrators).\nA fourth group considered it a miracle that the Prophet foretold things that would happen in his life and after his death. The last kind in particular is the strongest, everlasting evidence on the Prophet’s truthfulness.\nSome of the People of the Scripture (i.e., Christians and Jews) entered Islam by virtue of predictions in previous Messages. All Scriptures contained some description of him, whether explicit or implicit; even Hindu and Buddhist scriptures mentioned his exact name.\nIn addition, some considered that the Prophet’s miracle was his teachings about the spiritual refinement and elevation felt in obeying Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him). Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali wrote, “When you know about medicine or jurisprudence, you can identify doctors or jurists by observing their conditions and hearing their words, even if you do not actually meet them”. By the same token, if you understand the meaning of Prophethood and reflect deeply on the Qur’an and Prophetic reports, you will necessarily realize that the Prophet is at the highest level of Prophethood. To illustrate, consider his teachings relating to acts of worship and their heart-purifying effect. He said, “He who acts upon what he knows will be granted by Allah knowledge of what he does not know”.\nThe above are just examples of the countless miracles and signs demonstrating Muhammad’s Prophethood. But his indisputably greatest and eternal miracle is the Munificent Qur’an, a miracle witnessed by all succeeding generations of humanity with guidance to the Creator, the way to salvation and perpetual residence in the Abode of Righteous Souls, and the wisdom behind our existence in this world.\nIn the Book of Allah, each generation will find such clear signs that cannot be denied, {so that those who perished (through unbelief) would perish after having a clear proof and those who lived (in faith) would live with a clear proof}. That is, the door will remain always open for all generations to interpret the Qur’an, provided that the following basics are closely observed:\n1. Reports ascribed to the Prophet (peace and blessings e upon him),\n2. Reports ascribed to Companions (may Allah be pleased with them all), and\n3. Rules and considerations of the Arabic language (we will discuss this later).\nWith such principles in place, there will be no restriction on interpretation. Most probably, this does not fall under the Prophet’s warning in a hadith reported by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa’i: “He who speaks about the Qur’an out of his own opinion and speaks right will be making a mistake”. In the same line is Abu Bakr’s reply when asked about an ambiguous word in the Qur’an: “Which land will bear me and which sky will extend over me if I speak with my own opinion about the Qur’an?!”\nEvidence shows that someone may be blessed with a new understanding of something in the Qur’an that had never been understood before. The Prophet blessed Ibn `Abbas saying, “O Allah! Grant him subtle comprehension of the religion and teach him interpretation”.Scholars agreed that this means interpretation of the Qur’an. Moreover, Abu Ju7ayfah asked Caliph `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), “Do you have anything of Revelation that is not contained in the Book of Allah?” `Ali replied, “No. By the One who has split the grain and created humans, there know nothing of that except for such an understanding of the Qur’an given by Allah to some person”. That understanding is what we use when dealing with Qur’anic sciences. Al-Fakhr Ar-Razi said, “If early scholars have stated certain aspects in interpreting a Qur’anic verse, this does not mean that later scholars are not allowed to deduce other aspects in the same verse”. This applies to interpretations that were not reported from the Salaf (early Muslim generations) in particular.\nAs for scientific interpretation, however, it is controversial. Perhaps the best opinion to follow is stated by Ibn `Ashur in At-Tahrir Wa At-Tanwir (Liberation & Enlightenment): “Some scientific issues may be closely related to the interpretation of the verses of the Qur’an… as in the following verse: {Have they not looked at the sky above them (and see) how (perfectly) We have built and adorned it and how it is void of rifts?}. The intended meaning here is to consider the visible phenomenon; but if an interpreter goes deeper to explore that phenomenon using detailed knowledge from astronomy, then he will be better serving the purpose. Wehere possible, Qur’anic statements can be reconciled in meaning with well-established scientific facts, or they can be interpreted metaphorically. For example, the verse{And (remember) a day when We shall cause the mountains to pass away} can be taken as implying the annihilation of the earth with earthquakes, and the verse {When the sun enfolds} as implying that gravity will stop by the end of the world”.\nIbn `Ashur quoted Ibn Rushd Al-Hafid as saying in Fasl Al-Maqal (The Decisive Word), “There is a consensus among Muslims that not all the words of the Lawgiver should imperatively be taken literally, nor should they necessarily be interpreted figuratively. The reason why Shari`ah has surface structure and deep structure is that people vary in their thinking and in their persuadability”.\nHowever, the focus of this article is quite different: It discusses the agreement between Qur’anic statements and sound scientific knowledge (as stated earlier). Scientific miracle involves telling about cosmic information hundreds of years before it is discorvered by modern sciences. Allah says, {For every claim there is some fixed time (when its reality will come out)}. Such information has always been true and in effect, but the time to discover it was delayed for centuries, which is not contrary to the texts or objectives of Shari`ah.\nComponents of Scientific Miracle\nThe phrase “scientific miracle” involves two concepts: (1) science (which can be defined as the observasion, identification, description, experimental investigation, and theoretical explanation of phenomena; here, it refers to the cosmic facts which are discovered empirically and have some reference in Qur’anic or Prophetic statements) and (2) miracle (which denotes being matchlessly superior and preternatural).\nAnalytically, the scientific miracle has three aspects:\n1. Time: In the Revelation age, it was still beyond human capacity and knowledge to find out such facts.\n2. Person: It is impossible for an uneducated man with no scientific education whatsoever like Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) to come to know such highly sophisticated information.\n3. Delay: It is only modernly when such information has become known to humanity.\nGuidelines for Scientific Miracle\nIn fact, any approach to such a topic must be put within a Shar`i framework to avoid divergence, deviation, and chaos, otherwise it will be rather fabrication and blasphemy than an individual misperception. The Prophet strongly warned against this: “He who speaks about the Book of Allah without knowledge will be making a mistake even if speaking rightly”.\nThe following guidelines can be identified:\n1. The Qur’anic or Prophetic statement put in comparison with a scientific fact must have some explanation by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) or a Companion. For example, Allah says, {Have those who disbelieve not seen that the heavens and the earth were a patch, and then We separated them}. Ibn `Abbas interpreted the word “patch” as “conjoined mass”, the same interpretation given by Al-Hasan, `Ata’, Ad-Dahhak, and Qatadah.\nIt is not known how exactly such a conjoined mass was before the separation. Several ancient narratives coincide with the Big Bang theory, which purports that a primeval atom of an infinite energy density and temperature once exploded forming gas clouds, which kept expanding far and wide to fill in an empty universe. In April 1992, cosmologists noticed that initial findings of NASA’s Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite were consistent with the Big Bang’s predictions regarding the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation.\nIn his book Sharh Al-Maqsud Wa Al-Mamdud (Explanation of the Brief and the Elaboration), the erudite 12th-century-A.H. scholar Sheikh Al-Mukhtar Al-Kinti Ash-Shinqiti wrote, “The first thing created by Allah, the Almighty, was the atom, which roamed for a million years where there were no earth or heavens. And when He willed to create the worlds, He looked with an Eye of Majesty to it. Then, it evaporated and emitted the five elements: water, air, light, darkness, and fire”.\n2. Where there is no explanation by the Prophet or a Companion, the governing principle is to employ the rules and patterns of the Arabic language, interpreting the words according to the direct meanings attached to them in Arabic usage. This has two possible cases: (a) plain words that have just one meaning, and (b) ambiguous words that have more than one meaning and are determined dependent on context.\nIf a word is not self-explained or is context-bound, then it will require interpretation. One condition for good interpretation is to find some circumstantial evidence or analogy in a similar text, while keeping in mind the possible applicability of the less relevant meaning from a scientific, or at least linguistic, perspective. For example, Allah says, {And from it We have brought forth green (sprouts)}. Literally, the verse is talking about something green; but technically, it can be construed as referring to chlorophyll, which accords with scientific information.\nIt is worth noting that a scientific interpretation may be in line with factual observation but still has a different figurative aspect accepted by Muslim scholars. So, it must first be made sure that there is no explanation by the Prophet or a Companion, and only then, the scientific interpretation can be approved. For example, Allah says, {And We have brought down iron in which there is mighty force and benefits for people}. Knowing that an American research team proposed a theory of the stellar origin of iron, the bringing down mentioned in the verse must definitely be literal, not metaphorical. In the same sense, Al-Qurtubi reported a hadith that reads, “Allah has brought down four blessings from the heavens to the earth: iron, fire, water, and salt”.\nMost Qur’an commentators construed the bringing down allegorially as meaning the creation of iron, as indicated in At-Tahrir Wa At-Tanwir (Liberation and Enlightenment).\nThe above are general guidelines for any investigation into the scientific miracle of the Qur’an and Sunnah. They are regulative, rather than restrictive, precepts to ensure sound consideration of religious texts. Fundamentals of Jurisprudence scholars tell us that allusion is not to be considered if in conflict with the explicit textual indication; in fact, it will actually be inexistent.\nAlso, researchers can focus on broad issues in relation to the creation of the universe, such as the law of dualism highlighted in many verses. Allah says, {He has made for you from among yourselves mates and from (all kinds of) animals mates, thereby He multiplies you. There is nothing that is like Him. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing}.\nDualism is found even in plants: {And We have caused to grow in it (something) of every delightful variety (of plant life)}.\nIt comes also in the context of creation: {And the sky We have built with mighty Hands, and indeed We are expanders (of it). And the earth We have spread wide, and how excellent smoothers We are! And of everything We have created a pair so that you may become mindful. Therefore, flee to Allah. Indeed, I am to you from Him a clear forewarner. And do not make with Allah another deity. Indeed, I am to you from Him a clear forewarner}.\nThis dualism is a main characteristic of all creatures and evidence of need and dependence, while Oneness is an exclusive Attribute of the Creator, as indicated by the comparison in the above verses.\n\n\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "On the Fiqh of Muslim Minorities",
      "Answer": "\nThis week I attended the Conference on Moderation in London, which the Kuwaiti Ministry of Endowments and the International Center of Moderation in Kuwait had called. The conference was distinguished by its participants who had a variety of geographical and intellectual backgrounds as they came from different centres and associations in Eastern and Western Europe.\nThe goal was to study the Muslims’ cultural situation in the light of the principle of moderation that should govern Muslim’s life away from extremism and dissoluteness.\nOne of the aspects that were discussed was the foundations of the fiqh of Muslim minorities. This kind of fiqh is denied by some people while others take it beyond its limits. Thus, this is a field in which to seek moderation as it needs to establish its foundations. The foundations of the fiqh of Muslim minorities can be divided into objectives and rules.\nThe objectives are:\nFirst, a general objective, which is to preserve the religious life of the Muslim minority on both individual and community levels.\nSecond, spreading Islam among the majority of the population. This in turn will lead to establishing Islam on the ground.\nThird, establishing the basis of the relation with the other amid the cultural and international status quo in order to find a state of mutual trust and acceptance, a matter which may not be confined to the case of Muslim minorities due to the international situation.\nFourth, establishing the communal fiqh in the life of Muslim minorities; that is, moving from individuality to collectivity.\nAs for the rules, this does not mean to reinvent new jurisprudential or juristic rules. This means rather to focus while searching on the rules existing in our jurisprudential and juristic heritage which are closer to the status quo of the minorities so as to re-examine it and to discover the possibilities of dealing with the situations of the minorities.\nLike other branches of fiqh, the fiqh of Muslim minorities refers to the two sources of shari`ah; namely, the Quran and the Sunnah. But with regard to the details, it refers to the universals of the shari`ah that require removing hardship, applying the rulings of necessity, taking into consideration the widespread cases in both acts of worship and transactions, considering the change of place equal to the change of time, warding off evils, inclining to the lesser of two evils – which some people call the fiqh of balancing – and the consideration of the considerable public interests not the inconsiderable one.\n“The shari`ah is based on wisdom and on achieving people’s interests in this world and in the hereafter”, as ibn al-Qayyim said in I`lam al-Muwaqqi`een.\nThe shari`ah has attested to the genus of these universal principles in innumerable texts.\nSecond, the fiqh of Muslim minorities refers to particular texts that apply to issues found in the countries of minorities and shared by the Muslim majorities.\nThird, the fiqh of Muslim minorities refers to a particular principle adopted by some scholars who consider the situation of Muslims who live in non-Muslim lands as a reason to drop some of the shari`ah rulings. This is known as the issue of “the abode”, which we call “the ruling of the place”. This position is reported on the authority Amr ibn al-`Ass, a Companion of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), and on the authority of some scholars such as al-Nakh`iy, al-Thawry, Abu Hanifah, Muhammad, Ahmad, according to one narration, and `Abd al-Malik ibn Habeeb, a Malikite scholar.\nThis is based on some ahadith such as the prohibition of executing penalties on non-Muslim lands. Abu Dawoud, al-Termidhy, and Ahmad reported with a strong chain of narrators “Hands shall not be cut off while being in a state of travelling.”\nBased on these principles, on universal and particular evidences, and on the opinions of the people of knowledge, ijtihad seeks to give preponderance either on selective or innovative basis. Personally I prefer the first kind and dare not adopt the second except on the basis of ramifying from a previous scholarly opinion; because in the first kind one chooses from among the opinions of the scholars to achieve an interest that requires this choice or to keep away an evil that may result from the application of the other abandoned opinion.\nTo be more precise, ijtihad here has three kinds: new ijtihad in order to bring about new opinion concerning new issues by using the process of analogy with the rulings stated in the Quran and the Sunnah. There is also ijtihad that is concerned with the proper application of ruling to the case. This kind of ijtihad never ceases, as al-Shatibiy said, because it is concerned with the application of an agreed upon rule to a new status quo. This kind is not like the first one which only the mujtahidun (practitioners of ijtihad) can assume. Rather, both the mujtahid and the muqalled (imitator) are equal in this regard.\nAs for the third kind, it is ijtihad to give preponderance to one juristic position. This position could be non-preponderant at some time due to the weakness, not the nonexistence, of its bases. Thus, scholars choose it for an interest that requires this choice. This is what is called by the Malikites as “the running practice”.\nThus, handling these three kinds of ijtihad should be in the light of the three aspects that govern the process of fatwa; namely, the status quo of the Muslim minorities, the universal evidence, and the particular evidence.\nFrom all this, the fatwa comes up amid dialectic, interrelations, integration, and interaction that result in balancing between the evidence and the status quo that enables the jurist to regulate the fatwa and see the ruling through the rank of need, the rank of evidence, and the rank of issuing the ruling and also through balancing between the universal and the particular. This is a subtle sort of treatment where neither of them could be neglected. Rather, each of them should be duly considered when forming the ruling. Therefore, the Malikites have set what they called “the intermediary rule” according to which when there is one issue that has two aspects, two different rulings should be given due the presence of two pieces of evidence.\nYou will see these kinds of ijtihad through observing the situation of Muslim minorities with regard to their marriages, financial transactions, food and clothes habits, dealing with people, offering congratulations in times of joy and condolences in times sadness, participating in political parties, nominations, elections, etc.\nMuslim minorities face stubborn challenges on the level of the individual who lives in an environment which has its material philosophy where there is no room for religious motives and on the level of the family that attempts to keep together in a society where familial ties have broken and the relation between the two spouses and between the parents and their children has no longer become founded on positive guardianship. As for the level of the minor Muslim community that dwells among these societies, they are scattered, unregulated, and uncollected. The challenges face also the creed in the sense of being a Muslim who believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers, whether according to the methodology of the Ash`arites, the Salafites, the Mu`tazilites or the like methods of interpretations that confuse laypeople.\nPerhaps the article of faith written by Muhammad ibn Abu Zayd al-Qayrawaniy in the introduction of his treatise, which has reference in the texts of the Quran and the Sunnah that are beyond controversy, is the best thing Muslims should learn in the lands to which they migrated owing to its simplicity and its being free from argumentation and confusion.\nThis also applies to acts of worship that require the formation of Muslim groups and Islamic institutions such as mosques, schools, and centres. This also applies to the relation with the other and how to find means of coexistence that keep the Muslim away from melting away in the other culture and at the same time safeguard him against isolation and seclusion to be an active member in the society following the suit of Joseph the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) when he said to Egypt’s king “Appoint me over the treasures of the land. I am a good keeper and knowledgeable.”\nAll this needs a juristic aptitude to balance between the evidence and the status quo with piety that is free from hesitation and brevity that is free from boldness.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "On Celebrating the Prophet’s Birthday",
      "Answer": "\nBackground:\nThe celebration of the birthday of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is an issue of controversy amongst the scholars. Thus, there were some who considered it a disliked innovation, a few even saying it reached the level of prohibition, and there were others who considered it a praiseworthy innovation.\nThis difference is traced back to a divergence concerning the division of innovation (bid’ah). Some scholars recognized the validity of such innovations and this was, primarily, the school of Imam Al-Shafi’i (May Allah have mercy upon him) and the head of this thought was Al-’Izzi Adin Abdul Salam (May Allah have mercy upon him). In addition, Imam Al-Qarafi (May Allah have mercy upon him) who was a Maliki, carried this same opinion, giving it great attention , explaining it in an exhaustive manner. In his discussion Al-Qarafi (ra) expanded the concept of innovation to included innovations that were commendable, highly recommended, obligatory and a disliked nature. Thus, he divided innovation into five parts: (obligatory, recommended, permissible, disliked and forbidden).\nThere were some scholars who failed to accept this division contending that, “Any innovation, if it appears, then it is repulsive in nature.” They did this by restricting the statement of ‘Umar (ra), regarding the tarawih prayers, “This is a good innovation” to its linguistic meaning. There was a large body of scholars who held this opinion such as Taqi al-Din Ahmad Ibn Taymiyyah, Al-Shatibi, in his book Al-’Itisam, and many scholars from the Maliki and Hanbali schools (may Allah have mercy upon all of them).\nFinally, there were scholars who wrote in support of celebrating the Mawlid such as Al-Suyuti (May Allah have mercy upon him) and, at the same time, there were others who wrote against it. Thus, in my opinion, there is no need to drag this discussion out, nor continue to argue about it any longer.\nThe Ruling:\nWhoever wants to celebrate the Prophet’s (sa) birthday should celebrate it and avoid doing any action contrary to Islamic Law. This act should be done with an intention that it is not a sunna nor an obligatory act. If these conditions are observed, and one is careful not to contradict Islamic Law, out of sincere love for the Prophet (Peace and blessing of Allah upon him), then, Allah willing, there is nothing wrong with this action and this person will be rewarded.\nCommenting on this, the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (May Allah have mercy upon him) said, “Indeed, such a person will be rewarded because of his intention.” Likewise, for the one who shuns this celebration, seeking to cling to the sunna out of fear of falling into innovation, then this person will also be rewarded, Allah willing. It is important to note that this is not a big issue. Nor is it necessary to give it more attention then it deserves.\nThe Methodology:\nOur attention towards this issue is directed towards uniting the Muslims and curbing these differences. We base this understanding on facilitation (for both sides) and ease. This ease is not founded on an empty premise, but is referenced directly back to the Quran, traditions of the Prophet (sa), the fundamental objectives of Islamic law, and the order of the Prophet (sa) to work towards unity between others. If a contentious issue arises pertaining to a matter, we exercise great consideration and respect for both sides. This consideration is not simply an act of being overly accommodative, as some contend, or attacking those who hold weak opinions. But, this respect and consideration for differences is guided by the fact that both opinions are based on proofs from Islamic Law. In some regards these proofs are clear, and in other regards the opposite holds true. Thus, some (scholars) have provided evidences for these acts’ legitimacy, and others hold proofs for the opposite. In conclusion, our stance is that both are on goodness, Allah willing, as long as this act is not mixed with some type of evil and the intention is correct.\nAllah knows best.\nTranslated by Suhaib Webb\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "On Religion and Violence",
      "Answer": "\nThere are still wrongful accusations launched against the civilisational image of Islam, notably the one stating that “Islam is a religion of violence in essence, and a religion of rupture with the other,” depending on mistaken excerpts from the Qur’anic texts.\nIn the following, we shall clarify the image and prove that it is possible to counter such an approach against the others, bearing into mind that our Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance as indicated in a previous article.\nWe should compare this approach with the following texts taken from the Old Testament in order to see how Islam is indeed the true mercy sent to the worlds. In the Torah, for example, nations are divided into two categories. With regard to the first category, Jehovah asks his people to offer others conditions of peace [When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it] (Deuteronomy: 20:10), and if such conditions are accepted and they surrender, they should  be slaves to Israel [And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.] (Deuteronomy: 20 11) However, if they did not surrender peacefully then you triumphed over them, then kill all their men by the sword [And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword: But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.] (Deuteronomy: 20: 13-14)\nNonetheless, such categorised and classified use does not apply to non-Hebrew peoples residing within the Promised Land, as they shall suffer a ‘curse’, a term often translated as ‘deprivation,’ ‘holy destruction’ or ‘the curse of destruction’. In the context of the theology of Deuteronomy, the infliction of a curse on a certain group is but an equivalent to complete genocide for their personal, social and spiritual life. The German scientist Thomas Schieffelin said: “We believe in the original Torah as a holy book from God, which contains guidance and light, but the human practices distorted the content and misused application.” Islam has established the relationship with the followers of other religions on love and righteousness, unless Muslims are not transgressed upon. Allah, the Almighty, says, {Allah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion and did not drive you out of your homes. Verily, Allah loves those who deal with equity.} Interpreting this verse, Ibn Al-Arabi Al-Maliki says, “To give them a share of the money.\nOur religion Islam also calls to spread peace. The Prophet (PBUH) said, “To spread peace (by saluting each other saying “As-Salamu Alaikum”; peace be with you) with respect to those you know and those you know not.”  This is a part of a Sahih Hadith.\nThere are fair testimonials by Western individuals on Muslims’ practices. For example, Thomas Arnold said: “If the Caliphs had chosen one of these plans (i.e., temptation to adopt Islam or extermination of Christianity), they would have wiped out Christianity as easily as what happened to Islam during the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella in Spain; by the same method which Louis XIV followed to make Protestantism a creed whose followers were to be sentenced to death; or with the same ease of keeping the Jews away from Britain for a period of three hundred fifty years.”\nRichard Staper, an English merchant who lived in Turkey during the sixteenth century, specifically in 1578, held a comparison between the treatment by Muslim Turks to Orthodox and the treatment by Spain to them, saying: “Though the Turks are in general of the fiercest nations, they still allowed all of them, the Roman Catholics and Greek Orthodox, to preserve their religion and follow their consciences as they chose: they allowed them their churches to perform their sacred rituals in Constantinople and many other places.  This is in contrast to what I can testify to from living in Spain for twelve years; not only were we forced to attend their Papist celebrations, but our lives and properties were in danger also.” The German researcher Thomas Schieffelin provides a picture of Islam as follows: Violence is not a virtue in itself; rather, Islam served to rectify the Arab tribal violence by subjecting it to the laws of God.\nAs explained by Goldziher (1850-1921), the term ‘Jahiliyah,’ which usually referred to the ignorance of the tribal society before Islam, has primarily a broader meaning, i.e., ‘Barbarism: Any uncivilized, reckless, and brutal behaviour by those who are not affected by the Divine Revelation and mercy.’\nComplaining of the treatment by the Polish Catholics to Polish Orthodox and describing them as cursed, demons of abomination, and ruthless-hearted because of their brutality in treating Christians, Patriarch Makarios said: “The Polish wish to exterminate people of the Orthodox faith. May Allah make the Turkish state eternal, because they do not interfere with the Jews or Christians, provided they pay their taxes. The Polish Catholics were not satisfied by taking the taxes and tithes from the brothers of Christ, but placed them under the authority of the Jewish oppressors, the enemies of Christ, who did not even allow them to build churches nor did they leave for them priests who know the secrets of their religion.” Finally, we should point out three things to be meditated on by the fair among the Westerners.\nFirst: When Islam appeared, the relations among the nations were based on the law of force which involved permanent hostility against the others if they did not surrender or fuse with the dominant powers in terms of religion, culture, customs and traditions. Under this situation, the teachings of the Islamic religion came to call for peace {But if they incline to peace, you also incline to it} and the establishment of treaties with enemies {Except those of the Polytheists with whom you have a treaty, and who have not subsequently failed you in aught, nor have supported anyone against you. So fulfil their treaty to them to the end of their term. Surely Allah loves Al-Mattaqun (the pious)}.\nSecond: Allah’s tradition with respect to His messengers and prophets is to commission some of them with certain duties different from those assigned to others. For example, some of them were assigned to call to worship Allah and undertake preaching and guidance as represented in the missions of Jesus (PBUH) and our Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) for 13 years from the beginning of his call to his companions to show patience and forgiveness, as some of them were tortured in Mecca and others immigrated to Abyssinia then to Medina. Also, some messengers were commissioned, in addition to the call for the way of Allah, to establish the ‘State of Right’, and they received a detailed Shari’ah (religious laws) which they were commanded to apply to people’s life, as represented in the mission of Moses (PBUH) as well as that of our Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) after his immigration to Medina and establishment of the state of Islam, requiring Jihad to repel the aggression and face the aggressors, along with the consequent mechanisms whose objective is to govern humanity according to justice.\nThird: The essence of the message cannot be judged according to the behaviours and actions of the followers of such message. Put differently, the behaviours of the Muslim rulers against their enemies throughout history were characterized by being right and sometimes wrong, and we do not absolve our history, but the right behaviours were indeed more than the wrong ones, especially when compared with the behaviour of our neighbouring Christians in their wars against Islam, whether in terms of the genocide practiced in Andalusia, the Crusades which lasted for two centuries, and the colonial wars that continued for three centuries, aborting any revival of the Islamic world. The two fathers Joseph Cook and Louis Gardier said that the Crusades broke down the Muslims’ civilisational launch.\nAs for this war, which has started with the beginning of this century and whose end cannot be known except by Allah, the Almighty, and according to the testimony of Christian historians, the blood of innumerable numbers of innocent Muslims as well as Jews was shed. They demonstrated barbarity unparalleled in history except under the Tartars military attack on Baghdad. However, they did not apologise to the Muslims as they apologised to the Jews. Is it possible then to attribute to Jesus (PBUH) the ruthless practices committed by the Christians against humanity? Does the Pope have the courage to apologize to the Muslims instead of repeating the Byzantine controversy? We shall continue with the rest of papal statements in episodes to come.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Offering Jumu`ah Prayer in Musalla",
      "Answer": "\nI am a graduate of the Islamic University of Madinah. Some brothers invited me to give the Friday Kutbah in a Musalla (praying place) in their company. I found that entering the company is restricted to the staff only due to security reasons and the nearest mosque is 10-15 minutes away by foot. I am not sure whether the company allows its employees to go to the mosque or not. The number of worshippers inside the Musalla is 10 in the summer and 35 in winter. Even if I refuse to give the Khutbah, they keep on offering Jumu`ah prayer in that small Musalla.\nThe basic ruling is that they should go to the mosque to offer Jumu`ah prayer and not pray it in the Musalla, as long as the mosque is near. It is not permissible to pray in this Musalla unless there are reasons like the ones mentioned in the question. If the company has a strict policy that prevents its employees from going to the mosque, they can pray in this small place. The Hanafi school of jurisprudence stated the permissibility of offering Jumu`ah prayer in two or three mosques at the same time. Yet, if the company does not ban its employees from going to the mosque, there is no reason to stay in the small praying place. They should go to the big mosque and offer Jumu`ah there. This is the opinion of the majority of scholars (may Allah be merciful with them all): holding more than one congregational prayer not due to narrowness or farness of the mosque is not permissible.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "On Befriending Non-Muslims",
      "Answer": "\nThe topic of this responsum is the delicate matter of wala’ and bara’ – usually glossed as “loving and hating for\nAllah’s sake”. The questioner states that she has a female Christian friend, and would like to know whether\nsuch friendship contravenes the Islamic teachings or norms.\nThe Response\nAll praise be to Allah. To proceed:\nThere is no problem in this, Allah willing. For Allah, Transcendent and Exalted is He, says: Allah does\nnot forbid you to be benevolent and equitable to those who have neither made war on your religion\nnor driven you from your homes. Allah loves the equitable.2\nThis verse, as the majority of scholars hold, is one whose legal provision still holds; it has not been\nabrogated.3 Consequently birr, or benevolence here, embodies the notion of kindness, justice and\nfairness. This goes to prove the permissibility of such friendship, providing this friendship is not based\nupon creed (‘aqidah) – meaning, that they not be loved for their [false] beliefs. As for relationships\nwith them in the worldly sense, Allah, Exalted is He, says concerning non-Muslims parents: Bear them\ncompany in this worldly life in kindness.4 An authentic hadith records that the Prophet, peace be\nupon him, instructed Asma’ – when her disbelieving mother was about to visit her: “Treat your mother\nkindly.” Recorded by al-Bukhari, no.2620 and Muslim, no.1003.\nThus, friendly relationships from a non-creedal angle is not that type of mawalat, or loyalty and\nfriendship, that Allah prohibits. There is no issue at all with such an affair, or with intending to steer\nher towards guidance through good conduct and character. If Allah wills, this is part of inviting others\nto Islam.

      "Question": "Negligence after Ramadan",
      "Answer": "\nOur venerable sheikh, one question puzzles me. Fasting in Ramadan is not only to abstain from bodily desires of sex and food. It is a sort of training for the soul to become pure, to respect others, and to stay away from grave sins in general. But with the advance of time we have started to give Ramadan more propaganda via satellite channels during the month… My question is why do I see after the elapse of Ramadan the spread of corruption, injustice, lying, disputes, and prohibited practices? What is the reason? Has fasting become and ordinary practice for the majority?\nIn fact, it is a responsibility that we all share to call to the way of Almighty Allah and to ask people to adhere to the word of piety and to be after Ramadan as they were during Ramadan. Evil souls among jinn and human beings do their utmost in this point. Thus, everybody should shoulder the responsibility and make some effort to guide people to the straight path; each one according to his level of ability. The person in authority should use his authority to do this. Scholars and callers to the way of Allah should provide clarification and proof and call people to the true path. The lay person should do as far as he can and at least deny evil practices by his heart.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Muslims Living in Non-Muslim Lands",
      "Answer": "\nThe Shaykh’s Insights on the Muslims’ Condition and Responsibilities in America  \n[Bismillah irahman iraheem. The shaykh began his talk by praising Allah subhaana wa ta’aala and sending prayers on the Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam.] I wanted to speak tonight about your conditions, your circumstances here. You are a group that is small in number and yet strong in faith, a group that has diverse ideas and understandings and whose individuals come from many different cultural and ethnic backgrounds, a group that is few amongst a dominant group that is many. The dominant group is strong in many areas; in fact, they are controlling many areas of the world. I would like to speak tonight about what the priorities of such a group would be: What are the obligations of such a group? What are the responsibilities of such a group? I would like to present some ideas to you, and I hopes that Allah subhaana wa ta’aala helps me to present some ideas that relate to a methodology, to approaches, and to things that will be beneficial to this group if they implement them.\nI want to speak about the responsibilities that you carry here. In contrast to Muslims living in the dominant Muslim world at large, you are, in many ways, strangers in a strange land. The Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said, “Tuba lil guraba.” In other words, the conditions of the stranger are blessed conditions, and it also means, “lahum al-jannah: they have paradise” for bearing the burden of alienation. An Arab proverb is, “ya ghareeb kun adeeba: oh stranger in a strange land, be a man of courtesy and cultivation.” There is also a hadith, “Islam began alienated and will return as it began, alienated. So, blessed are the alienated ones.” This alienation should not mean that you distance yourselves from the rest of the people. That is not the meaning of this state of estrangement. It does not mean you should not work with others or that you should avoid the dominant society and distance yourselves completely from it even though your state is one of estrangement.\nSince we know that Islam has legal injunctions and that Muslims have a code of law, a question that occurs immediately to us in looking at these conditions here is whether or not there are rules in our deen that apply to one land and do not apply to another land. As we know, the Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said that Allah subhaana wa ta’aala has made incumbent upon you to fulfill certain obligations, and Allah has also set boundaries for you, so do not transgress those boundaries. As we know, these rules in Islam relate to every Muslim. In terms of human beings, every one is equal in relation to these rules. You cannot say that one Muslim does not have to pray and another one does. All Muslims who are responsible adults have to pray. So, these rules of prayer and fasting, what are know as the arkan al-Islam-the pillars of Islam, the foundations of Islam-are things that are binding upon all Muslims, no matter where they are or what place they are in.\nIn addition, there is another type of set of rules in Islam that is known as al-ahkam as-sultania, and these are rules related to governmental authority, to the state. These rules involve certain things, such as the penal code of the Muslims. There is a code related to criminal law: if you do this, then this is the punishment. The implementation of those laws is related to the ahkam as-sultania or the rules related to the legitimate authority of the state. The ahkam as-sultania include the rules related to jihaad-in other words, martial activity in which men fight in war and battles. They also include the rules related to zakaah collecting: the gathering of wealth that Allah has obliged people to pay. In addition, they relate to the establishment of imams, not only the greatest imam, who would be the khalifa, but also the aaimma who will be in the masaajid and the qadaat who are the people who give the khutba on the jumu’a. All these types of things are traditionally related to the authority of the legitimate governing body of the Muslims. Muslims need judges; they need courts; they need police-all of these things relate to these ahkam. These types of rules which are known as the ahkam as-sultania are not the concern of those people who are living in a land in which there is not a legitimate state authority of Muslims.\nIf we want to look at an analogy, we will find it in the Makkan stage of the Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam. If you look at the Makkan period, the Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, was not making any claims to government authority. He was calling people to tauheed: the unity of Allah. He was calling people to prayer. He was calling people to the purification of their hearts. He was calling people to leave shirk. All this is known as the jihaad of the tongue: jihaad al-kalima; it is not the jihaad of the sword-or now the gun or the atom bomb or whatever. It was the jihaad of the tongue. Allah subhaana wa ta’aala said, “jaahidhum bihi jihaad al-kabir.” “Jaahidhum bihi” means to struggle against them with the Quran. In other words, “speak the Quran to them, and struggle against them with the truth in word;” and this was the jihaad of Makkah. You can say in a modern sense that this is speaking with a strong tongue in the face of wrong, in the face of injustices.\nWhen the Prophet, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, went to Medina, a different stage began, and there was now a jihaad of a physical type, a martial struggle where they went out. However, Allah subhaana wa ta’aala says to fight them until the war comes to an end. This type of jihaad has an end in time, and yet jihaad in its broader understanding in the sharia’ never ends. The struggle for the sake of Allah never ends as long as somebody is in this abode. This is why jihaad is the expenditure of one’s efforts for the sake of good. It means to do good things. It means to exert one’s effort in the society to help people, to expend one’s wealth-to give charity-to change the conditions around you: if they are bad, make them better. This can be done without martial effort in many places, and this is still a type of jihaad. This is why it is wrong for people to narrow the understanding of jihaad to some limited definition which only gives the understanding of military struggle because that is not what jihaad means in Islam.\nNext, I would like to address the issue of our responsibilities. Given our state of weakness and our minority status here, the governmental aspects of the sharia’ do not apply to us. We are not legally responsible for the governmental aspects because of our condition here. Given that, what becomes our responsibility? If Allah has removed from us those governmental responsibilities here, what then are the responsibilities that we have? I want to look at two aspects.\nRelationships of Muslims with Other Muslims \nThe first aspect concerns the relationships that we have with one another. These relationships have to be based on brotherhood. They have to be relationships based on love. Since we are minorities here and are few in number, we have to understand that we need to have solidarity. In order for us to have solidarity, there is something that is very important that we must understand about our legal structure, which is the jurisprudence of difference of opinion: fiqh al-khilaaf. We have to look deeply into this because if we understand this, this is a way in which we can be united and have good feelings towards each other and not negative feelings based on our understandings of valid differences of opinion amongst us. This last week in the classes that many of you have attended, we have been looking at usool al fiqh: the foundations upon which our fiqh is based. We looked at many differences of opinion amongst the scholars and how they were linguistically valid, how they were actually differences of opinion that had foundations; they were not differences based upon empty opinions. They were differences based on real issues that have validity and substance. If we understand that, this will enable us to rise up spiritually to another level of relationship with our fellow Muslims. It will take us to a higher level so that we begin to have differences that are still based on love and mutual respect. We will begin to see that there are different ways of doing things and that there is validity in them all.\nWe can learn a lesson from the western people who have individuality as one of the foundations of their culture. They respect the rights of people to explore their individuality. There is some good in this understanding, and the Muslims should learn from this even though it is originally from our own tradition. We should see that part of their strength lies in this ability. What this will enable us to do is build bridges. Despite the fact that there are two different opinions which place us in two different positions, this love and mutual respect enables a bridge to be built from one perspective to another perspective, and this creates contact; this creates the ability for us to visit each other, to be together. We should look at these hadiths in which the Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said, “the Muslims are one hand;” “the Muslims are strong;” “a Muslim is strong by his brother;” “the Muslims come together as one hand against those who oppose them;” “the Muslims are like one body: if one part becomes afflicted with some illness, the rest of the body shares in that affliction with insomnia and fever.”\nFurthermore, the Quran says, “Do not disagree:” do not “tanaaza`u” that is a strong word in Arabic. It is different from “ikhtilaaf: disagreement.” “Tanaaza`u ” is saying, do not have conflict with one another-not disagreement-but conflict. Do not have conflict with one another, and if you do that, the wind that gives you strength to move forward will dissipate, and you will fail in your task. You will fail in what you want to achieve. Allah subhaana wa ta’aala said, “Rectify what is of between you.” That is, Allah says to rectify the differences that you have. Rectify the hearts, so that you come together. The Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam,said, “Al-muslimu akh ul-muslim: The Muslim is a brother of his fellow Muslim.” He does not oppress him nor does he give him up to the enemy. Thus, all of these are indications that we should be together in spite of our differences if those differences are based on valid fiqhi differences; and this is why we must look into the jurisprudence related to differences of opinion.\nWe should look at these differences of opinion like different trains that are carrying different baggage or that are going to different places. These trains could be traveling on the same track at different times. If you do not organize them, the result is a disaster. They will crash. But if you organize them, the trains could be using the same tracks even though they are going to different destinations, have different concerns, and have different purposes. So, the blessing of organizing these differences is that the differences do not cause us to crash into each other so that we do not get anything done in the end.\nIn a sense, we could look at this like a famous fable. There is a legend about a lion and three bulls who were in the jungle. One of them was white, one was yellow, and one was black. The lion was not able to eat these three bulls because if he came near them, they would all stand up together, and each one of them would face the lion, so he could not eat them. The lion began to think about how he could get them to become divided.\nHe saw the bulls grazing once, and he approached the black and the yellow ones, and he said,  “You know that white one over there” He kind of looks like the people around here. He’s different from us. Why don’t you let me eat him?”\nThe two bulls said, “Yeah, go ahead. Get rid of him.” So, the lion went and ate the white one.\nThen, the next day, the lion came to the yellow bull, and he said, “Haven’t you noticed that you and I look the same? We have the same color. We’re really cousins! And this black one over here-he’s different from you.  So, why don’t you let me eat him?”\nThe yellow one said, “Yeah, you’re right. Go ahead.” So, the lion went and ate him. Then, on the third day, the lion came for the yellow bull and said, “I’m going to eat you.” The yellow one replied, “I was eaten the day you ate the white one.”\nThis is what happens when you get separated. You lose your strength; you lose your power to do anything. We have to realize that what unites us as Muslims is so much greater than what divides us as Muslims. Our areas of difference are very small in relation to our areas of agreement. This is why we should recognize the power of being together setting aside our differences. In the western world, you have arbitrators. In the whole world, you have arbitrators. You don’t want to bring in a judge. You want to bring in somebody who arbitrates. What an arbitrator tries to do is get both people to be satisfied so that one does not lose while the other wins. An arbitrator will try to get each group to compromise a little bit, to come to some kind of compromised agreement where they are both content; each one has given up a little bit, but in giving up, they have come together, and there is a win-win situation. You go to the qaadi (judge) as a last resort-”aakhiru dawaa’ al-kay: surgery is the final remedy.” You do not go to a surgeon the first time. The surgeon is always the last one you go to in the line of specialists. Doctors will try to cure you in other ways first and will send you to the surgeon as a last resort.\nOne of the disasters of the situation that we find ourselves in here is that you have Muslims making hijra to these lands from the Muslim world bringing their baggage along with them. So, they are bringing all of these problems with them that have nothing to do with the new circumstances they find themselves in. Furthermore, the challenges that they have in these new circumstances are so great that these problems that they are opening up are causing all kinds of trouble for them. Thus, the are not able to unite. They are not able to do things to benefit them because they are arguing about all these ridiculous things. There is something that we can learn from in the qawaa’id of the Maliki school. [The shaykh gives legal opinions or fatwas from all the schools even though the primary school that he studied was Maliki.] This particular qaa’ida is one that you find only in the Maliki school. This interesting qaa’ida is “jama’til muslimeen taqumu maqaam al-qaadi: a group of Muslims can stand in lieu of a judge.” That is, the group can actually take the place of a judge.\n[I told the shaykh the other day that there is an American researcher who says that the twelve jury system that we have here in America is from the Maliki school. It was actually taken by western people from the Maliki school. The principle is that a jury of peers will judge you because in those days they did not have qaadis (judges).] The wisdom behind this principle that Imam Malik was indicating is that when people come together, there is a synergistic power of unity in which they will more likely be right in their judgments than wrong. So, if the group makes a judgment, this is why their judgment has the weight and authority, in the Maliki school, of a legal scholar making a judgment based on his knowledge of the sharia’.\nThe Need for Three Institutions \nThe Mufti \nIn order for us to come to a point where we can work together in spite of our differences, or with our differences, we need three institutions. The first one is the institution of fatwa. Fatwa is a non-binding legal opinion. It is not binding on all the Muslims. It is binding on those who ask for it, but it is a non-binding opinion, and there is room for differences and other opinions. The mufti is somebody who gives legal opinions based on the understanding-on the ijtihaad-of all of the different areas of need in the sharia’, such as marriage, the rules of buying and selling, the rules of prayer, and the rules of tahaara (cleanliness and purification). The mufti is involved in all of these different things. So, we need a muassasa that deals with this for the Muslims. They need a sound source for guidance when these issues occur in which there are differences.\nThe Court \nThe second institution we need is a muassasa of tahkeem, which is an institution that issues rulings. In this culture, it is called people’s court. A people’s court is where the state does not get involved with the case. The parties that are differing agree to go to somebody who will listen to both sides and then make a judgment, and that judgment becomes binding upon them based on the prior agreement of the two. This has been done already in the United States in Texas, so there are Muslims that are doing this, and we should be competing with them in good.\nReconciliation \nThe third institution we need is the sulih. A musassasa deals with sulih which is reconciliation. It deals with bringing people together. Somebody brings the differing groups together and reconciles between them so that they can work together or work separately in peace; thus, they are not fighting each other, undermining each other’s work.\nAll of these institutions are necessary, but it is impossible to get these without having the least amount of respect and desire to bring this about. There has to be a desire for this, and if the desire is not there, then it is a disaster. Furthermore, setting up these particular institutions is not different from setting up other organizations such as those that are created for social issues, for helping the needy, and for doing all the other different things that organizations do. These three institutions are necessary for us in order for us to move on and to resolve a lot of the things that are causing disruption.\nRelationships Between Muslims and non-Muslims \nThe first thing we looked at was our relationship between Muslims in these lands living together. The second thing we have to look at is the relationship that we have with non-Muslims. Now, an issue that we must look at is that of the abode: the daar. Although there may be some people who are educated in Islam who are aware of this issue of the abode, there are many people who are unaware of this issue. In fact, you will even find some people who are fuqaha, scholars of Islamic law and the legal system, who are unaware of this issue. The issue of the abode is this: most people think that the world is divided into two abodes, the abode of peace and the abode of war. The abode of peace is the land of the Muslims, daar al-Islam, and the abode of war is everywhere else. In Nixon’s book that I read a translated version of called Seizing the Moment, Nixon wrote a long chapter on the Islamic phenomenon of the modern world. One of the things Nixon said after praising Islam a great deal and saying many nice things about Islam is that one of the most fundamental problems with the Muslims is that they view the world as a dichotomy of two abodes: the abode of peace and the abode of war. So, the central aspect of international relationships with the Muslims is aggression; it is one of war. This idea is wrong. There are three abodes: there is the abode of peace, the abode of war, and then there is the abode of treaty where there is a contractual agreement between two abodes.\nFor instance, when I came into this country, they issued me a visa, and I signed something. In the issuance of the visa and my signing of it, a legally binding contract occurred which was a sulih. It was an agreement that when I came into this country, I would obey the laws and would follow the restrictions that this visa demanded that I follow. This was a contractual agreement that is legally binding according even to the divine laws. In looking at this, we have to understand that the relationship between the Muslims living in this land and the dominant authorities in this land is a relationship of peace and contractual agreement-of a treaty. This is a relationship of dialogue and a relationship of giving and taking.\nRight to teach Islam \nWe should remember that when the Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, was in Makkah, what he asked for from the Quraish was just that they left him alone to do his da’wa. He said, “Khalu bayni wa baynan naas: Leave me alone to talk to these people. Let me speak to them; let me call them.” And they wouldn’t let him do that. However, in this country, the ruling people are allowing you to call people to Islam, and this is exactly what the Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, was asking that they allow him to do in Makkah. These people here are allowing you to call people to Islam. They are not prohibiting you. If you go out and proselytize, they don’t come and arrest you; they don’t punish you; they don’t torture you. This idea here should be understood, and the verse from the Quran that we should take as the overriding verse in our relationship with this people is where Allah subhaana wa ta’aala says concerning those who neither fight you because of your religion nor remove you from your homes that He does not prohibit you from showing them birr: righteousness. “Birr” in the Arabic language is the highest degree of ihsaan-it is the ‘aala daraja of ihsan. Allah does not prevent you from showing them excellence-moral excellence-in your transactions with them nor from sharing with them a portion of your wealth.\nQadi Abu-Bakr, Ibn ‘Atiyah, and others have also said that this is what “antuqsitu ‘ilayhim” means. You give non-Muslims qistan: a portion of your wealth. In the early period of Islam, this is ta’lif al-quloob: one of the things that they used to do in order to bring people close. They would give monetary gifts to people whom they saw had inclinations towards Islam in order to draw the hearts. The Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said, “give gifts to each other and love one another.” So, the act of giving something naturally inclines the one who is receiving the gift to have feelings of love towards the person who is giving them. The reason for doing these things-for treating these people with respect, showing this good character, and having this good courtesy-is that you will get from amongst them those who respond and will actually enter into Islam. This really is how we should see our relationship. The Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, not only gave gifts to some of the mushrikeen in Makkah, he also received gifts from them because his goal was that they become Muslim. He did not want to fight them-that was the last resort. The goal was that they become Muslim, that they enter into Islam.\nNon-aggression and honesty \nAlso, it is necessary for us to show respect to these people. Islam prohibits us from showing aggression towards people who do not show aggression towards us. The Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said, “Do not enter the houses of the Christians nor eat anything of their fruits except with their permission.” Islam prohibits theft; it prohibits fraud; it prohibits cheating; and it prohibits these things in relation to the Muslims and in relation to the non-Muslims. The things that you cannot do to a Muslim, you also cannot do to a non-Muslim. The Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, also said, “None of you truly believes until he wants for his brother what he wants for himself.” Imam Shabrakhiti ibn Rajul al-Hambali and others mentioned that “brother” here not only means your brother Muslim because this is a close brotherhood of Islam that others are not in, but it refers to the greater and broader brotherhood of our Adamic nature. It is a brotherhood in the sense that we are all from Adam, that Adam is the father of all us. Understanding this should cause us to realize that we have distant relations with all of these people out there, and all of them are potential Muslims. We should see them as potential Muslims.\nAllah, subhaana wa ta’aala, for that reason says, “Call to your Lord with wisdom and with a beautiful admonition, and dispute them in the most excellent of ways.” In other words, debate with them and dialogue with them in the most beautiful of ways. Don’t be argumentative; don’t be cruel; don’t be mean; don’t humiliate them. Do it ways in which they can listen to the truth, respect the truth, and come to the truth. For this reason, we have to be du’ahtis salaam: people who are callers to peace.\nWe also have to be good citizens because an excellent Muslim is also an excellent citizen in the society that he lives in. This does not mean that we lose our distinction, that we become completely immersed in the dominant society to where we no longer have our own identity-that is not what I’m calling to. We have to maintain those things that are particular to us as a community, but we also have to recognize that there are other things that are not particular to us but rather general to the human condition that we can partake in; and these things are not things that we should be ignorant and neglectful of but things that we should be engaged in. We have to maintain our roots. We have deep roots in our faith, but at the same time we have to be open to allow others to come into that deep-rootedness.\nIn addition, we have to recognize that the creation itself is a creation of diversity. It is a creation in which you see variation of colors. Allah did not make all the trees one, and He did not make all the animals one. He diversified the creation. He diversified even our colors and our languages; and He did all this for a wisdom. Not only that, Allah subhaana wa ta’aala made us on different religions and different paths, and He did that intentionally because He said in the Quran, “They continue to be in differences except those whom your Lord has shown His mercy to, and for that reason He created them.” So, Allah subhaana wa ta’aala is saying that He actually created us in order that we differ-that there is a wisdom, a divine wisdom in the differences that we have. He created us to show mercy to us as well. So, we have to rise up to this challenge. This is a high challenge, and we as Muslims have to rise up to this challenge.\nModeration: avoiding the Extremes \nAnother thing that is very important for us to remember is the moderation of Islam. This is a deen of wasatiyyah: it is a deen of moderation. We are a moderate community. We are between the two extremes of excess and deficiency. We are in the middle. The Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said, “Those people who go into matters too deeply will be destroyed.” [The shaykh is an expert in the Arabic language, and he said, “those people” are people involved in “tatarruf” or extremism. That is what “tanata`u’” is.] The Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said, “The extremists are destroyed,” and he said, “Beware of extremism in the deen.” The Prophet, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, warned against extremism, and he did not like it. Notice that one of the things that extremism does is that it causes you to lose your rational component so that you are not able to weigh things rationally. Once you have gone to an extreme, you can no longer see things in any balanced way. You have lost that balance of the middle way. This makes you think that what you are doing is right even though it is clearly wrong to others.\nThe Khawarij \nAs an example, take note of the Khawaarij when there was a difference of opinion between Sayidana ‘Ali and Sayidana Mu’awiyah, radi Allahu ‘anhuma. They differed. Sayidana ‘Ali was the legitimate khalifa, but Mu’awiyah did not take baya’ with him; they had differences. So, they called for arbitration. At that point, there was a group of people who were with Sayidana ‘Ali, radi Allahu ‘anhu, and they were extremists in the deen. They interpreted the Quran on their own whims. When they heard that Sayidana ‘Ali had accepted arbitration, they quoted an ayah which says, “La hukma illa lillah: There’s no arbitration except by Allah.” Allah is the only one that can make judgment. So, they said, how can you call a hakam into this situation for them to decide when it is Allah who will decide this situation? Sayidana ‘Ali, radi Allahu ‘anhu, replied that the ayah is a true word but that they were using it for a false purpose. They did not listen to him despite that he said and proved to them in the Quran there are many instances where Allah subhaana wa ta’aala calls for arbitration where people must be brought to decide: between marital disputes; on the on the Haj, when somebody breaks a tree or kills an animal; and there are many other examples of that. Their extremism prevented them from seeing the truth, and this is why things have to be weighed in the balance of the sacred law and of the rational, middle understanding of a human being that is balanced in his nature.\nThis means that we should not fear, but we also should not be aggressive. In other words, we should not be people who are cowards, and there is cowardice in our nature, but nor should we be people who are extremists, going to the other side and being aggressive. An example is people who blow up innocent people in the name of religion and do things that the sharia’ is really completely against. These are means that they are using that are unacceptable to the deen of Islam. What they end up doing is creating a completely distorted picture of Islam so that people who are outside of Islam are completely repelled by it and are not attracted to Islam. This is why Imam Shaatabi, radi Allahu ‘anhu, wrote in his Muwaafaqaat, one of the greatest books written on usool al-fiqh, that this sharia’ lies between excess and between want. It is the middle way; and the Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said, “Khair ul-umoom ausatuha: the best of affairs are those that lie in the middle.”\nOther Matters of Importance \nNext, I want to go into some more detail in looking at the general aspect of our condition here. I already spoke about the two most important concerns which are the relationships between Muslims amongst each other and the relationship between Muslims and the dominant culture. Now I would like to go into a few important points that relate to more detail. The first thing is that it is absolutely essential that you respect the laws of the land that you are living in. There are a number of reasons for this, but the least of this is the principle “al-muslimu la yudillu nafsa: a Muslim does not place himself in a state where he is humiliated.” You are living in a land in which the people are very serious about their laws, and if you break the laws, this can result in you being tried as a criminal and being sent to prison and being completely humiliated as a Muslim where non-Muslims are putting you in a cage and preventing you from your own human dignity of freedom and other things. So, it is essential that we remember that.\nExtenuating circumstances \nThe second thing I want you to understand is that your circumstances here are not normal circumstances by any means. You are in very unusual circumstances, and because of that, there are certain things that the sharia’ allows that it does not allow in times and places where those circumstances do not exist. One of things that is really important for you all here to really take to heart is that the textual positions which we have concerning women that are more lenient should be applied in these lands. We should open up the situation of the woman, not to where it takes us outside the pail of Islam-that is not what I am saying at all-but where we remain within the pail of Islam, and take it to positions that go to the limits of facilitation for the women. Among those are, for instance, the position of the Hanafis stating that a woman can marry without a wali. That is because the conditions of men and women in this land necessitate that type of a ruling. However, the ideal situation is for her to have a wali, and the wali can be any one of the Muslim community male members if she is new in Islam and does not have anybody to do that for her, but the Hanafi position should be seen as a valid position because it is a valid position, and we should not fault women who take that position.\nUnusual valid rulings \nIn addition, we should remember that there are positions in Islam that today to many Muslims are quite shocking, such as the decision of Imam Fadari. He was an imam mujtahid: he had his own madhhab. Although it is no longer being applied, he had his own madhhab, and he was recognized by the other Muslims as a valid imam. He believed that a woman could be a qaadi in all the areas of sharia’. He said that there was nothing in the sharia’ that would prevent a woman from being a qaadi if she had the intellectual and educational background to fulfill that role. Also, Imam Abu Hanifa radi Allahu ‘anhu stated that a woman could be a qaadi in everything other than penal matters-blood and things that are related to blood-but in the other matters that did not concern blood, she could be a qaadi. So, it is important that we really broaden that area, but we should use that broadening to work for Islam and not against Islam, and we should take this into consideration.\nAnother matter that is important is zakaah. The Muslim organizations in this country need to play an important role in the collecting of zakaah. Even though it is permissible for people in the absence of a legitimate Islamic authority to give zakaah to whom they please, there is a need for zakaah here, and there are organizations that are working in areas which are beneficial and are working to help people.\n[The shaykh used the examples of Rahima and Zaytuna who are doing this type of work because he has come here for a short time, and he knows only those two names, but this includes the many, many organizations in this country that are working for Islam, that help people, and that know the needs of their community.]\nThese are organizations people go to when looking for help. Whereas they might not go to you and know that you have zakaah to give, they will go to that organization because it is a name; they know of it; and they will say, “I need zakaah.” So, those organizations should be able to facilitate the movements of zakaah money to the people who are worthy of taking the zakaah. That is important, and obviously, these organizations which you give to should be ones that you feel are trustworthy.\n[Next, the shaykh gave an example of a situation that he was involved in where there was a need for facilitation that related to the jumu’a prayer.] I am a member of a fiqh counsel in Europe which has an number of scholars including Dr. Yusuf al-Qardawi; it is called The Counsel of Islamic Legal Rulings in Europe. We go to Europe for our meetings, and this year, we met in Germany. One of the issues that was placed in front of us was the issue of laborers who work in factories and are not able to go the jumu’a at the time it is done. The council agreed that in these types of circumstances, we need to look at the easier rulings. For instance, in the madhhab of Ahmed ibn Hambal, radi Allahu ‘anhu, the khutba is permitted to be delivered before the actual time of the prayer comes in. We need to take rukhas, which are legal licenses, to facilitate for people because of our conditions here-we are not living in a Muslim country where the ruler is encouraging the practice of the prayer and actually making sure that the prayer is being said in its right time-[and we know that rulers in many countries don’t do that even in the Muslim world now any way]. This facilitation also includes the joining of prayer. It is acceptable to join Dhur and ‘Asr at the time that they share according to Imam al-Qaraafi in his majestic work, The Khira. Imam al-Qarafi is a famous Maliki qaadi, and it is understood in the Maliki school that there is a time in which the prayers are shared between Dhur and ‘Asr. There is also such a time between Maghrib and ‘Isha. There is a valid opinion amongst the recognized fuqaha of the sunni school-not of the shia’ school-that enables the delaying of Maghrib until the time of the ‘Isha prayer when they meet at that point. So, in circumstances where people really have a difficult time, it is better that they join their prayers rather than lose their prayers altogether because if you do not present those options for them, there are people who say, “I can’t pray. It’s too hard. I’m working and this and that;” and their iman might be weak. So, in these types of situations, there has to be facilitation for these people.\nWhat is prohibited in Islam is the joining of all five prayers at one time. You cannot do that. You cannot do that. Some people wait until the end of the day and pray them altogether. No. You have to pray in the times that the fuqaha have allowed for in the joining of the times.\n[This should not be an excuse for people to say, “Oh great! The shaykh just gave me a fatwa, and now I don’t need to worry.” He is talking about situations that are really difficult for people. He is not just saying go out and do what you want. No. You know your deen is your most important thing that you have; and your prayer is the most important thing in your deen after your tauheed; and whoever does not guard the prayer has not guarded his deen. The prayer has times, and they are prescribed times. But what the shaykh is saying simply is there are situations where people really do have a difficult time, and the Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, in a sahih hadith in Bukhari according to Ibn ‘Abbas, radi Allahu ‘anhu, joined the prayers. They said to Ibn ‘Abbas, “Why did he do that?” He replied, “So that his ummah would not have difficulty and feel bad about doing this later,” and he said, “the Messenger of Allah, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, was concerned about even the last of his ummah.” The Messenger, sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, in a hadith, said, “Ikhwaani, ikhwaani: my brothers, my brothers!” at the Kabah, and Abu Dar, radi Allahu ‘anhu, said, “Aren’t we your brothers?” But he replied, “No, you’re my sahaba (companions).” He said, “My brothers come after me. They believe in me and they’ve never seen me.”]\n[The shaykh had given me permission to add anything that I had thought was important, so he just reiterated what I had added about the importance of prayer.] You should not make the joining of your prayer a norm, but in certain excruciating circumstances, that is a valid position which is recognized, and it becomes an option for people having difficulty. Another thing to remember is the importance of your neighbors. Your neighbor has rights over you. These rights are inclusive of the Jewish, Christian, and other neighbors you may have. There are many examples of that, but a story that comes to my mind is that of Abu Hanifa, radi Allahu ‘anhu, who is called imam al-’aadham: the greatest imam.\nIt is well known that Abu Hanifa, radi Allahu ‘anhu, did tahajjut every night. He would spend his night reciting the Quran. He had a neighbor who was an alcoholic, and he used to drink a lot and sing love poems. This used to bother the imam. But one day, the imam did not hear this man’s revelry, so he went and asked about him. They said, “Oh, so-and-so. They took him to jail.” So, the very well respected imam went to the jail. He was the most respected imam and qaadi at the time in that place. When the ruler found out the imam went to the jail, he asked for the reason and was told that the imam was concerned about his neighbor who had been arrested. So, the ruler said to release the man, and he was released. The neighbor then asked Abu Hanifa why he did that, and he replied, “Because you have a right upon me as a neighbor, and I have not been neglectful of that.” That was the reason that the neighbor made tauba to Allah subhaana wa ta’aala.\nNext, there is another subject that may be a little difficult for some people to understand, even for some people of knowledge, but I am not in any way claiming to have more knowledge than those people, and I am certain there are people who have come here who have greater knowledge than me. This subject concerns the difference between ahlu l-dhimma and ahlu l-’aahad. Ahlu l-dhimma are people who are in a minority status in the Muslim lands. Ahlu l-’aahad are Muslim people in minority status in non-Muslim lands. Each of these groups has different rules that apply to it. In relation to the people of ‘aahad, there are things that we have to understand.\n[The shaykh explained that he is giving you his personal opinion, and it is the amaanah (trust) of the translator to relate that.]\nI feel it is important that people are concerned with political candidates in this country. If we support the candidates who are known to have positive attitudes towards the Muslims and who are supportive of Muslim causes and even those who are just better people than the opposing candidates, in the usooli knowledge, this would be considered taking the lesser of two evils. In a non-Muslim situation, voting and not voting are both not good situations, but as a community that does not engage themselves and yet is affected by the political instruments, the lack of participation can end up being a greater evil than the participation itself. This is something that has to be looked at and balanced. In my opinion, it is probably a greater evil not to be participating at all and to simply be disengaged from the process. So, as Muslims, people should come together as one hand and create blocks to where they can try to have some influence to the best of their ability.\nFinally, I ask that Allah subhaana wa ta’aala, in sha’ Allah, gives me taufiq in what I have said and that I have not said anything inappropriate. I ask that that it benefits me and also benefits you in sha’ Allah. [Then the shaykh made a du’ah that Allah subhaana wa ta’aala, in sha’ Allah, accept this from us and give us taufiq. Jazakum Allahu khairan.]\n\n Original Source Link \n",

I am thinking of leaving her and moving out to another house in order not to be affected by her words. Is this the right decision?\nDo not leave your mother, and keep on treating her well, but beware of falling prey to her temptations. Allah says, {Give thanks to Me and to your parents; unto Me is the final destination. But if they strive with you to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and obedience} (Luqman:14 and 15).\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Moving the Dead from His Grave",
      "Answer": "\nMy father passed away while I was a little boy. Soon after his burial, my mother moved his body from the charity graveyard to another private yard she had bought. As you most probably know, in my country we give great importance to such matters and we could not allow him to be buried in a charity graveyard. Is my mother a sinner for doing this? Is it true that the deceased will be questioned twice in this case? If we want to visit his grave, should we visit the first or second one? May Allah reward you well!\n What your mother did is not permissible. When the dead body is buried it no longer belongs to anyone, even if it is in the disbelievers’ graves. It is not permissible to move it unless for the benefit of the Muslims. The basic ruling is that each corpse’s grave belongs to the corpse  and it cannot be moved unless there is a necessity. What your mother did is not permissible, as it was based on traditions, not on any rule in Shari`ah. As for visiting your father’s grave and whether to visit him at the first or the second grave, this is based on where his body is. If his whole body or remains were moved, then you can visit him at the second grave, but if he had decayed in the first grave and was not put in a cascade, then visit him in the first grave. It all depends on the remains which you moved from the first grave, whether it was the body or just what the mother thought fit to move. Regarding the questioning of the deceased, a person is questioned once he is put in his grave. The questioning process is not repeated and there is no evidence in Sunnah that supports this idea. One is questioned by the angels once he enters his grave. This is the answer regarding the questioning process, but if you are asking about his life in Barzakh, it continues whether he is in his first or second grave. If he was living it in Paradise, it will continue so, and if otherwise, it will continue so as well. We ask Allah to protect us and all of you!\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Moderation in Religious Verdicts",
      "Answer": "\n Q- What is meant by moderation?\nA- “By moderation we mean a comparison between the universals [of Shari’ah] and its particulars; a balance between the core aims [of Shari’ah] and its secondary branches and a strong correlation between the fixed [texts] and consideration for the changeable [texts related to] benefits [where applicable] when giving religious edicts and opinions without additions or subtractions.”\nImam al-Shatibi said in al-Muwafaqat:\n“The competent mufti, of the highest authority, is one who carries people to a natural balance which is appropriate for the masses. He does not lead them to the way of extremism, nor does he lean with them towards the excess of unbridled liberalism. The evidence for this is that it [the way of balance and moderation] is the straightway which the Shari’ah brought. Thus, it operates on the premise that the goal of Shari’ah, for the one charged with worship, is to bear [his-her religious articulation], upon moderation, without any excessive hardship nor disproportionate ease. Therefore, if the Mufti goes beyond this [balance], in dealing with those who seek fatwa, then he has left the aim of the law giver [Allah]. For that reason, anything that goes beyond the range of moderation is considered debased by the scholars. “\nTranslated by suhaib webb\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Migration to a Muslim Country",
      "Answer": "\nWe want to migrate to a Muslim country. How can we get out of a non-Muslim country to a Muslim one while the Muslim country does not accept us? The worst thing is that they prefer non-Muslims to work for them, though we have better qualifications. We want to stop paying taxes to them, because they use this money to strike the Muslims and also store it up for themselves. We want somebody to help us to migrate to a Muslim country.\nAll praise is due to Allah alone. Peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah. This question has various aspects: First, the questioner asks about how to get out of a non-Muslim country to travel to a Muslim one. It is known that this “how” is governed by systems, laws and customs. One needs a visa, job and other things that this site (Islamtoday) may not be able to provide for every Muslim who wants to leave a non-Muslim country to go to a Muslim one; because Muslim countries have their systems and authorities in this regard. The other thing is that the questioner says that he does not want to reside in a non-Muslim country, which is a good feeling. However, we say to him, “Allah never tasks a soul beyond its capacity.” [2:286] If he can fulfill the rites of his religion and is able to worship Almighty Allah in such a non-Muslim country, he does not have to leave. Ibn Hibban reported (4861) with a trustworthy chain of narrations that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to Fudayk, “O Fudayk! Duly establish the Prayer and shun evil, and you may dwell wherever you like in the land of your people.” One of the narrators thought that he said, “then you will be an émigré.” The tribe of Fudyk were non-Muslims and he dwelled with them. He came to ask about immigration. Therefore, therefore according to three imams and in mostly the three fiqh schools; namely, the Shafi`tes, the Hanilites and the Hanfites, if one is able to fulfill the rites of his religion, migration is not obligatory. Malik (may Allah have mercy with him) together with the Zahirites have different opinions. Thus the issue is broad. “Allah never tasks a soul beyond its capacity.” If he can go to a country where he can practice his religion better, this will be good. But if he cannot, he should know that the issue is broad. Some scholars, like al-Mawardy, maintained that if one can practice his religion, he should not even leave and should remain in the country; because if he leaves, the country will be void of Muslims. The issue is broad. We ask Almighty Allah to grant success to us and to the questioner and to guide Muslim countries to receive Muslims instead of receiving others, and to hire them instead of hiring others, particularly those who are skilled and competent, as indicated in the question. As for the issue of paying taxes to the non-Muslims, he ought to pay the taxes in order to protect himself and his property. There in no harm in this. Allah knows best\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Mocking the Messenger and Islamic Triumph",
      "Answer": "\nI have repeatedly heard that if the Noble Messenger (PBUH) is ridiculed, this is considered an indication of a forthcoming triumph for Muslims. Is there any evidence for this?\nAll we have on this matter is mere implications, not decisive Shar`i texts. Scholars can act upon implications only if they do not clearly contradict with the apparent denotation of the texts. One such implication is found in the Qur’anic verse: {Truly! We will protect you against the scoffers} [Al-Hijr: 95]. Those were people who mocked the Prophet (peace be upon him), and he invoked curses on them. Thereupon, Allah destroyed them entirely. Another example is: {Indeed, it is the one who hates you (O Muhammad) that will be cut off} [Al-Kawthar: 3]. This verse talks about a person who hated and antagonized Prophet Muhammad, so Allah deprived him of blessings and descendants. A third example is: {So, Allah will protect you against them, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower} [Al-Baqarah: 137]. All such verses imply that those who mock the Prophet will be doomed and that he is protected against whatever disturbs him. After all, these remain just inferential evidence, not express statements. Anyway, we already see how such incidents of ridiculing the Prophet have caused Muslims everywhere to unite and consolidate, which is a sign of the Blessings conferred by Allah upon His Messenger. We ask Allah, the Almighty, to crown our unity and zeal with an outstanding victory.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Answer": "\nIf a slaughterer mentioned another name along with the Name of Allah when slaughtering an animal, would that animal be lawful to be eaten? For example, someone said, “In the name of Allah, in the name of the Messenger.”\n It is not permissible to mention other than the Name of Almighty Allah when slaughtering an animal. But is this slaughter valid or not? If he did not intend with this word to associate others with Almighty Allah, but it was just to seek blessings, the animal he slaughtered would be lawful. Nevertheless, in this case we should advise him not to add any other name to the Name of Almighty Allah. Almighty Allah says, “Thus you shall not eat of that over which the name of Allah has not been mentioned.” However, if he did not intend to associate others with Allah, we cannot go to the extent of deeming the animal he slaughtered as unlawful.

      "Question": "Linking Islam to Terrorism Made Us Defensive",
      "Answer": "\nDuring the last few days, Al-Watan (Saudi newspaper) published the report of the American House of Freedom about religious curriculums, which accused them of promoting bigotry. Al-Watan asked his eminence, the savant `Abdullah ibn Bayyah – vice chairman of the International Union of Muslim Scholars about his opinion and he answered:\nLinking Islam to terrorism has put us in a state of defence since September 11th. The issue of curriculums is only a part of this campaign. This problem has been raised since these events and has contributed in the promotion of false ideas and prejudiced judgments about Islam due to misunderstanding of Islam as a creed and shari`ah and misjudgement based on certain practices, which are irrelevant to Islam, committed by extremists. In America, and the West in general, there is a problem with the construction of these Western communities that has been associated with principles and rules that have resulted from the development of these societies. This includes, for example, the secular and material orientation of these societies. Although positive philosophies and atheist trends have recently dwindled in the West, there has been a strong presence of the tendency of desacralising everything and reducing religion to be just a personal issue.\nBut these people do not comprehend the religious and spiritual values for Muslims. Most of the materials written about Islam in school curriculums present Islam from the perspective of these curriculums, not as it really is. The result will be the distortion of the image of Islam in the minds of the students. They persist on presenting it as a religion that cannot cope with modernity.\nMedia and school curriculums are interrelated. Media channels address the audio-visual perception more than mind and critical conscience. Media channels together with certain study and research centres complete the job of school curriculums when they launch campaigns against Islam and attempt to link it to the practices of some militant and extremist groups to impugn it, out of ignorance, with terrorism. They ultimately aim at implanting a correlation in the recipient’s mind between Islam and violence. These goals reveal as much abhorrence to Islam in no less degree than deliberate negligence of the objective facts.\nIt should be considered that the amendment of curriculums involves no harm for Muslims, particularly if the goal is to unify the Islamic ranks and to remove the reasons of conflict and disagreement between Muslims. The call to amend curriculums is not heretical in order to take a stance of enmity and warning against it as if it involves transgression against heavenly teachings. The call for amendments was adopted by a group of Muslim people that have realized the harms that result from certain wrong curriculums that have been taught here and there.\nBut I really wonder of how these centres have ignored the magnitude of distortion of Muslims in the Zionist school curriculums. One of the main principles adopted by Israel in its school curriculums for children is to distort the image of Arabs and Muslims and misjudge them. It is enough to read this text as an example “Arab rulers are killers. They are responsible for the bad conditions that the Jews suffer in Arab and Muslim countries. In 1868 and 1906 a lot of Moroccan Jews died in Malalah ghetto. Let alone the repeated attacks, murdering, looting, and terrorising they faced at the hands of Muslims in Morocco. In 899 A.C. 2500 Jews died of smallpox because the Jews were banned to live or dwell outside Malalah and they were forced to wear black clothes and walk with their heads downcast and were prevented from meeting with Muslims.”\nOne can say that educational curriculums are related in general to the existing policy and each curriculum has a philosophy. However, the Israeli educational curriculum is one of the curriculums that are closely related to the Zionist ideology and the Hebrew state. This curriculum shapes the general intellectual vision of the generation after they have been isolated and prepared for the educational process. Therefore, this American report is politicised, prejudiced, and untrue.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Killing Innocents under the Pretext of Jihad?",
      "Answer": "\nThe attack that took place in Eastern Aleg, on December 24, killing four innocent French visitors, who had entered Mauritania legally and showed respect to the country and its people, has caused much sorrow to Mauritanians both at home and abroad. It was shocking not only to Mauritanians but actually to everyone who knows Mauritania.\nMauritanians have always been far from violence and armed actions, due to two factors: (1) Mauritanians’ deep understanding of Islam, the religion of tolerance and peace, and (2) Mauritania’s sociologically undivided and closely related community, where the individual would be afraid of stigmatising himself as well as his family or clan if he commits a crime.\nBasically, this gross act is against the Islamic teachings that prohibit killing innocent human souls, and it is even more detestable because it was committed during the sacred month of Dhul-Hijjah, while Muslims are just coming back from Hajj.\nDeclaring war against others on the false pretext of “jihad” is something strongly disapproved of by any religion as well as by any sound mind. It distorts the pure image of Islam, drives others away from it, and misrepresents the true concept of jihad, reducing it to militia operations, murder, and destruction.\nIn addition, such an act is detrimental to the interests of the whole nation, both individually and collectively.\nWhile Mauritania is attempting at all levels — governmental, party, and public — to improve citizens’ quality of life, and while the world is devoting considerable efforts to help Mauritania rise up from backwardness (as we have seen in the Paris Club meeting), and while the nation is enjoying unprecedented freedom of thought, expression, and da`wah, a bunch of gangsters just come up and commit such an extremely hideous crime.\nThose perpetrators had deviant religious ideologies, turned away from the values of their nation, never cared for the good of their homeland, and acted in complete disregard to the devastating consequences of their deeds (such as terrorising people, maximising risk of foreign intervention, deteriorating the country’s reputation, and discouraging domestic investments, which require stability and security).\nIt is the duty of everyone in this country — leaders, politicians, and citizens — to mobilise and combat such erroneous ideologies. Muslim scholars and intellectuals have a particularly important role in refuting the malicious thought that seeks to plunge society into chaos and turmoil and to implant intimidation and insecurity into Muslims’ lives.\nWe ask Allah, Exalted be He, to protect us, our country, Muslim countries, and all humanity from evil and tribulations.\nThis atrocious attack is totally contrary to the tolerant spirit and religious beliefs that Mauritanians have been known for throughout history. All Mauritanians, at home and overseas, have to censure such grave incidents, whether in word or deed, and to educate the youth about the gravity of such an invading culture that has no grounds in our religion and value system and endangers the future of our nation.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Language of Divine Books",
      "Answer": "\nIn which language were the Torah, the Evangel and the Psalms sent down?\nThe Torah was sent down in Hebrew, assuming that what exists now is the original Torah. The Jews say that Moses (peace and blessings be upon him) broke the Tablets. Of course, we read in the Quran that Almighty Allah said “So when Moses’ wrath abated, her retrieved the Tablets.” Thus, to us the Tablets were not broken, though they say that he broke them and thus he needed to rewrite the Torah. But they also say that the Torah was totally lost during the Babylonian captivity and was written thereafter by one of the prophets of the children of Israel. It is said that he found a copy of it and rewrote it. Anyway, it is beyond doubt that there are many distortions and alterations in the Torah. But it apparently was sent down in Hebrew. The Psalms were also in Hebrew, for David was one of the prophets of Israel. As for Jesus, none knows if the language he spoke was Aramaic or Hebrew. This is not clearly determined in history. In addition, the existent four gospels were written such a long time after Jesus that it is hard to say that they constitute what was sent down to and spread by Jesus. Some of the Apostles wrote the gospels: the gospel of Luke, the gospel Peter, the gospel of Mathew and the gospel of John. These four gospels were written after Jesus (peace and blessings be upon him). Therefore, none knows whether they were written in Aramaic or in Hebrew. Allah knows best. Now the gospels are in other languages, after being translated into Latin and then to English, such as the James’s Gospel. Thus, the gospels are now in languages other than their original ones.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Khul` Without the Consent of Husband, Permissible!!",
      "Answer": "\nPeace be upon you. My husband divorced me weeks ago and then he took me back. Now I want to ask for khul` but he has told me that he will not make the same mistakes (namely, not spending on me or providing a house, as I used to pay for everything). However, I do not want to keep living with him. I want to know if it was his right not to give me khul`.\nThe husband has to spend on his wife. If she asks for khul` after this, he has the right to accept or reject. This is the position of the majority of scholars. The husband does not have to accept the wife’s request for khul`, but it is recommended that he should accept it and not keep her while she is reluctant to stay. But if she insists, the judge should interfere to examine the reason for such schism, whether it is the husband or the wife, and send two arbitrators. Almighty Allah says, “Then, send an arbitrator from his people and another arbitrator from her people. If they both desire reconciliation, Allah will bring about harmony between the two of them.” [4:35] Sending the two arbitrators is very important in the Shari`ah. If it becomes apparent that the husband is responsible for the problem, they can enforce the divorce. If the problem is on the wife’s side, they should ask her to observe the etiquettes of the matrimonial relationship. If no reconciliation takes place, the judge should ask the husband to accept her request for khul`. Thus the position of the majority of jurists is that the husband does not have to accept khul`. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) ordered Thabit ibn Qays to part from his wife who asked for khul`, and he said to her, “Will you give back his garden to him?” She said, “Yes.”  [Sahih al-Bukhary (5273)] This was a recommendation, but not an obligation.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Joint Declaration on Syria by 107 Muslim Scholars from throughout the Arab World",
      "Answer": "\n\nA joint declaration by 107 leading Moslem scholars from 15 Arab countries released overnight is urging:\n\nAll Syrian military and security forces to disobey regime orders and join the uprising\nThe Moslem world to extend material and moral support to the Syrian resistance and the Syrian Free Army (SFA)\nArab and Moslem nations to sever diplomatic ties with Damascus\nFull protection by insurgents of the rights of Syria’s religious and ethnic minorities\nUrgent humanitarian aid for Syrian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey\n\nMoslem scholars who signed the declaration are from Egypt (25), Saudi Arabia (16), Kuwait (12), Libya (9), Morocco (7), Mauritania (5), Yemen (4), Sudan (4), UAE (4), Germany (4), Qatar (3), Syria (3), Lebanon (3), Bahrain (3), Jordan (3) and Tunisia (2).\nThe most prominent among them include the Mufti of Egypt Dr. Ali Gomaa, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi of Qatar who heads the International Union of Moslem Scholars, SheikhAbdullah Bin Bayyah of Mauritania, Sheikh Salman al-Ouda of Saudi Arabia, SheikhAbdulmajeed al-Zindani of Yemen and Tunisia’s Sheikh Rashid al-Ghanoushi.\nTheir joint declaration in full:\nSyria’s despotic regime and its supporters are meting out violence, torture, and bloodshed against this beloved country’s innocent people. It is a black stain that will never be forgotten. God will make the innocent blood of the Syrian people a shame and pestilence upon those who shed it and those who stood by and said nothing, as well as upon the individuals, organizations, nations, and institutions that have allied themselves with the corrupt regime.\nEvery day brings news of dozens or even hundreds of new deaths, and the number of those who are maimed is many times higher. Families are being driven into exile, atrocities are being committed, and a violent security crackdown is being systematically pursued, even in the face of clear and absolute worldwide condemnation.\nThe undersigned invoke the principle, enshrined in the Qur’an and in Prophet Muhammad’s teachings: that all human life is inviolable and sacred, as are all the human rights that Islam upholds and protects. Indeed, the Qur’an links the sin of bloodshed with no less than the worship of other than God, when its says: “And those who do not worship other than God, nor kill a soul in other than the dispensation of justice, nor commit adultery…”\nThe Qur’an also warns us the murderer is deserving of God’s wrath, His curse, and eternal damnation. God has decreed anyone who kills any human being, except in the dispensation of justice as a punishment for murder or in confronting those who spread violent mischief in the land, it is as if that person has killed humankind. Likewise, someone who saves the life of any human being, it is as if that person has saved all of humanity. On this basis, we issue the following resolutions:\n1.    Members of the Syrian military, security forces, and other armed bodies, are forbidden to kill any member of the public, or to fire in their direction. Moreover, it is incumbent upon them to disobey any order that is directed at the public, or that will result in killing members of the public. Moreover, it is their duty to stop serving in those bodies and to cease all involvement. Those who have already killed members of the public should bear in mind that the crime of killing two people is double that of killing one. The door to repentance is always open. They should recall the story of the murderer who repented to God after killing 99 people, take heart, and refrain from causing further bloodshed. They should not let their past offenses make them despair of God’s forgiveness. It is better to be killed for refusing than to be a killer. Someone who dies an innocent martyr is better than someone who kills others and as a consequence goes to Hell. We declare it is forbidden to continue serving in any position with Syria’s military or security forces under the present circumstances. It is their duty to disengage from those bodies and to also stand against them.\n2.   We call on people to support the Free Syrian Army in defending Syria’s civilians, population centers, and institutions, so long as the Syrian public is being targeted by the regime. We call upon the Moslems and upon the free world to assist the Free Syrian Army in every possible way, whether materially or morally, in order for it to mobilize itself for the role of preventing atrocities. It is, in turn, the duty of the Syrian Free Army to exercise control, avoid any deviation from this noble purpose, and refrain from acts of vengeance or aggression against the innocent. Any ignoble act on their part will only endanger Syria’s future national unity.\n3.    It is necessary to support the Syrian resistance, materially and morally, with what they need to keep up the struggle and win the freedom and human rights of the Syrian people.\n4.    We call upon all Arab and Moslem nations to take a firm diplomatic stance against the Syrian regime by expelling its ambassadors and cutting off diplomatic ties. We also call upon them to take a firm diplomatic stance against the nations supporting the regime, particularly Russia and China. We likewise call upon all Moslem people and public institutions to send messages of protest to those two countries, protest in front of their embassies throughout the world, and boycott their products. They should demand that those countries stop using the blood of innocent Syrians as a means to protect their military and economic presence in the region. Those countries should know the future of the region, sooner or later, rests with its people. Those who gamble on supporting a regime’s despotic crackdown killing its own citizens are surely making a losing wager.\n5.    We call upon the Syrian resistance, the Transitional National Assembly, and all other organized bodies to join ranks and set aside their differences – now and in future. They should resolve with full sincerity to build their future nation on the basis of justice, human rights, and freedom, and to set up institutions that will ensure its territorial integrity and its people’s welfare. It is their duty to protect the rights of Syria’s religious and ethnic minorities. These minorities have been an integral part of the Syrian people for over a thousand years. They, like everyone else, enjoy full citizenship rights. The present regime alone bears responsibility for the atrocities being committed.\n6.     We call upon the sincere forces in the Moslem world to organize grassroots efforts everywhere in support of the Syrian people’s resistance, and to provide aid for the refugees and those whom the conflict has displaced to places like Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. These people have a pressing need for food, clothing, medicine, and moral support.\n7.    We give our support to every effort being made to safeguard the lives and unity of the Syrian people, and to save them from a protracted war that will only bring ruin to the country. We consider this to be in keeping with the main purposes of Islam’s teachings. These efforts should lead to free elections that will express the will of the people, represent the full spectrum of Syrian society, protect their rights, and ensure a sensible sharing of political power, as well as compensate the victims of the present conflict and the families of those who have lost their lives.\nWe ask God to hasten the relief of the beloved Syrian people, preserve their unity, and bring them together upon truth and justice. We ask Him to restore to them their security and stability under a just government that is truly committed to upholding their inalienable rights and freedoms, one that will never seek to dominate the people or succumb to corruption. May all their affairs ultimately fall to those who are virtuous.\n\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Islam’s Relationship with Other Cultures",
      "Answer": "\nDoes Islam promote a position of fanaticism and narrow-mindedness; or interaction and dialogue?\nLove and justice are the controls of the relationship of Islam with the ‘other’. This is provided that the ‘other’ neither forces us to leave Islam nor expels us out of our lands. The Qur’an explicitly states this concept in the verse that reads: “Allah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion and did not drive you out of your homes. Verily, Allah loves those who deal with equity.” (Al-Mum’tahanah60:8)\nThese are the prerequisites of Islamic friendship for other cultures or peoples. The verse is general in its application and includes all people and religions. Islam represents benevolence which embraces all kinds of good treatment, such as maintaining the ties of kinship, righteousness, philanthropy and goodness. As Islam promotes benevolence by placing it on the highest level of human relations, we in turn must find out how to practically put this divine command into application.\nOur children should be raised on the values of convergence, just as the western culture should be fair and balanced, so that we may reach a mid-way meeting point. Fanaticism makes a person blind and deaf regarding the other. Therefore, the actual criterion for justly evaluating the behavior of any culture regarding other cultures depends on its actions at times of triumph.\nFanatical behavior takes many forms and colours. History tells us about the organization of genocide and mass displacement against people, performed under the pretext that those people were ‘foreigners’. We will mention some examples of this behavior when we discuss the situation of Islam regarding the ‘other’. There are also many recorded acts of fanaticism, which have included people depriving others of their civil rights, personal and religious liberty by rejecting their views and values. We will provide testimonies of western authors and texts of the Shari`ah (“Islamic law”) that conclusively prove that Islam is historically not fanatic in any sense of the word.\nThomas Arnold once said: “If the Muslim Caliphs made use of one of the two plans, temptation or eradication, they would have easily destroyed Christianity, just as Ferdinand and Isabella did with Muslims in Andalusia, or Louis XIV who punished followers of the Protestant doctrine in France, or like the Jews who were kept banished from England over three hundred and fifty years.” (Da`wah to Islam, p. 99) According to the western thinker: “Muslims should be proud of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) who did not cause harm to anyone during the conquest of Mecca. Therefore, the people of Mecca embraced Islam in spite of the great enmity, hostility and wars against him. Rather, he said illuminated words, “This is a day of peacefulness and today the Quraysh is honored.” He said to them while he was standing by the door of Ka’bah and they were fearful surrounding him, “Go, you are free.”\n“The policy of religious tolerance adopted by Islamic governments regarding its Christian subjects in Spain and the freedom of mixing between followers of different religion gave birth to a degree of homogeneity and resemblance between both sides and marriage spread between them. Pope Adrian I expressed his concern about this familiarity between Catholics and Muslims.” (Da`wah to Islam, p. 159) These are just some of the testimonies that prove that the claims, that Islam aims to destroy other religions, are groundless. Yet, the texts of Shari`ah indicate a kind of acceptance of the existence and continuation of some cultures and commend their values. Almighty Allah says regarding Christians: “…and you will find the nearest in love to the believers those who say, “We are Christians.”” (Al-Maidah 5:82)\nIt was authentically reported in Muslim that Al-Mustawrid said to Amr ibn al-As: “I heard Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) saying, “The Hour will come while Romans are the greatest in number among people.”” Amr said, “Think about what you said.” Al-Mustawrid replied: “I have said what I heard from Allah’s Messenger.” Amr said: “Have you said that, they have four characteristics: they are the most forbearing people at times of sedition; the quickest recovering after disasters; the first to re-attack after retreat; the most benevolent towards the poor, the orphans, and the weak; and — the fifth and noblest feature-the most resistant to unjust kings?” (Sahih Muslim, Chapter of Fitan)\nIt is important to point to this commendation of the Romans and their culture, from one ofSahabah (“Companions of the Prophet”) who conquered and ruled Egypt. This indicates an early Muslim view of the Christian culture in the West and a deep understanding of the characteristics of their rival but with an equitable stance nonetheless. Almighty Allah says: “…and reduce not the things that are due to people, and do not commit mischief in the land, causing corruption.” (Hud 11:85) It was reported in a less sound hadith, regarding the end of the two great nations that: “Persia is one or two battles, then it is destroyed. Byzantium is generations, when a generation perishes another one succeeds it. (They are) people of patience, and people of patience are to live to the end of this world. They are your friends so long as living (with them) is good.”\nIt is reported in the hadith of Ibn Majah that the Sahabah of the Prophet (pbuh) who were in Abyssinia told him about an old Christian nun who was attacked by a young man from Abyssinia. The young man pushed her so that the water jar on her head was broken. She warned him against standing before Allah. The Prophet (pbuh) said to her, “Ratified, ratified.  How Allah sanctifies a nation in which the right of the weak is not taken from the strong.” (Ibn Majah 2718 of the Hadith Encyclopedia)\nThese words indicate the nomination of virtue, regardless of its origin and that following the example of other nations in their virtues is desirable because “wisdom is the aim of the believer.” That is the position of Islam, which is represented in the interaction of civilizations within a common human scope.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Islamic Financial Products",
      "Answer": "\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most-Gracious, the Most-Merciful\nSheikh Abdullah Bin Bayyah, Head of the Shari`ah supervisory board at Saudi Arabia’s Allied Cooperative Insurance Group (ACIG), ascribed Muslims’ weak response to Islamic financial instruments to inadequate marketing and lack of effective trust-building promotional strategies. In an interview with Alriyadh newspaper, Bin Bayyah clarified that insurance in general is associated to traditional financial institutions, which creates more suspicion and reluctance among investors and clients.\nThe prominent scholar warned Muslim governments and institutions against hasty adoption of real estate mortgage, which can immerse them in an economic recession like that currently suffered by the Western World. He called for enforcing Shar`i limits and guidelines to ensure validity of mortgage transactions, by possession of the mortgaged object, guaranteed delivery, and ascertainment of the mortgagee’s rights and safety from injury, as per the noble Qur’anic verse: {Then let there be a pledge taken (in mortgage)}.\nTransactions & Loans\nBanks and financial institutions can bolster customer trust by carefully designing their financial instruments and products and by having a Shari`ah advisory board with credible figures to help the client make sure that his property and transactions are Shari`ah-compliant. They also need to make all their rules and dealings as clear as possible, to avoid uncertainty and deception, which have done harm to many Muslims.\nCoop Insurance\nCommending the recent measures taken by Saudi Arabian government on cooperative (or Takaful) insurance, Sheikh Bin Bayyah said they will be facilitative and helpful for Muslims, provided that the applicable mechanisms are plainly stated, involving no obscurity or uncertainty, and serving the best interest of Muslims and clients. Religion advocates everything that results in benefit for Muslims, within the framework of Shari`ah as explained by scholars and specialists, he pointed out.\nBin Bayyah said that coop insurance, which has been substantiated into a Shari`ah-compliant economic model by Saudi Arabia’s Council of Senior Scholars, is free from any Shar`i violations. Coop insurance, he expounded, is an insurance bought jointly by several persons to cover any future losses incurred by any of the policyholders. The main purpose is to cooperate and minimize liability.

      "Question": "Islamic Economy vs. Western Economy",
      "Answer": "\nObviously, Islamic economy is not presented effectively. Existing models of Islamic banks and Shari`ah-compliant financial products have actually played some role, which is not bad, but there is much more they can contribute.\nGlobal economy is plagued with multiple ailments, some of which are technical and some in the underlying philosophy itself. And Islamic economy is well positioned to remove all such ailments.\nIn the global economic mentality, laissez faire et laissez passer (“let do and let pass”) constitutes the key maxim in business. It implies removal of all restrictions on trade and freedom from state intervention, placing the individual in the center of the whole economic structure.\nBy contrast, Islamic Shari`ah derives its reference from Allah, the Legislator, based on the concept of trusteeship. Allah says, {And spend of that whereof He (i.e., Allah) has made you trustees}. As a trustee or agent, man does not have absolute freedom, but should rather act within the framework of seeking good and warding off evil.\nIn the aftermath of 1929′s Great Depression, restrictions were imposed to regulate economy. With the advent of Thatcherism and Reaganism, economic deregulation and promotion of “individual initiative” started, inspired by the pioneering economic philosopher Adam Smith’s theory of the “invisible hand of the market”, which states that the marketplace has a self-regulating nature, by virtue of an invisible and benevolent hand.\nAll that entire system has now turned out to be a total failure. On the other hand, Islamic economy does encourage self-initiative and self-freedom, but within limits and guidelines that adjust the course of economy.\nIn terms of practical application, we find that only 5 percent of the global economy is based on real investment, while the remaining is mere venturing, prediction, and unreal wealth.\nOn the contrary, Islamic economy adopts the principle of exchanging wealth within society at large and not monopolizing it by the wealthy. Allah says, {That you exchange among yourselves}. Exchange is to be only of real wealth. In an authentic hadith, the Prophet (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Sell the less quality dates for (a sum of) dirhams, and then buy with the dirhams good dates”. Money is just a medium. We have principles of exchange, or circulation as Ibn `Ashur puts it, and transparency.\nHuge profits have been made there from usury, while it is utterly prohibited in Islam to exchange money for money. Even in the West itself, there are voices that argue against usury. Islam warns against the devastating consequences of usury: {But if you do not do (i.e., give up usury), then let it be a war (against you) from Allah and His Messenger}.\nBy the same token, Westerners practice factoring, while Islam bans selling a debt for another, according to a hadith narrated by Al-Bazzar.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Islamic Criminal Law",
      "Answer": "\nA historical glimpse over criminal laws:\nSince the dawn of history, man has lived a social life that necessitated organizing his relations with others through establishing rules that have a binding nature and must be respected in order to control aggressive instincts and the desires for debauchery “And [by] the soul and Him who fashioned it and informed it with [consciousness of] its wickedness and its righteousness!” [91:7-8] There is no society, no matter how backward or developed, degraded or advanced it may be, that has not such a kind of rules whose reference could be a divine law revealed by the Creator (exalted is He) to His messengers and prophets to establish justice and set the balance of straightforwardness “Very truly, We have sent Our messengers with clear [and miraculous] proofs. And We sent down with [each of] them a Book [to guide their people], along with the [just] balance, so that people might establish justice.” [57:25]\nThe reference could be customs and traditions or the wisdom of the sages and the theories of the philosophers such as the Hammurabi Code and the Roman systems and laws which constitute the basis of the modern European laws.\nOut of His grace on this Muslim nation, which received the final divine law, Almighty Allah granted it such as system that is complete and comprehensive in its fundamentals and accurate in its detailed rulings. It has organized human life in the most superb way and set it in the best order. Rights have been guaranteed, duties have been determined, justice firmly rooted and spread wide, and the truth has grown deep.\nOne of the most important of these systems is the criminal law that has guaranteed a safe life and protection for the society against the evils of criminality together with a rehabilitation of the criminal himself. Therefore, the penalty of each crime suits its consequences on the society and balances the degree of harm it causes for the individual and the society in a wonderful sequence and graduation through a system that never transgresses or does injustice. The shari`ah is broad in its horizons and concepts, clear in its declaration, firm in its well established texts, and continuous and developing in its objectives.\nIts broadness is clear in the saying of Almighty Allah “And We have sent down to you the [Quran as a revealed] Book to make all things clear.” [16:89]. Clarity of the declaration is manifested by the prophetic declaration in the Farewell Pilgrimage “Indeed, your bloods, your properties, and your honors are as sacred for one another as the sacredness of this day…”\nScholars of the ummah (Muslim nation) have honestly interpreted and expressed this in their definition of crime when compared with its Western definition. Law defines it as “Every offense for which the law prescribes a punishment”, whereas Muslim jurists define it as “Every aggressive act against a soul, religion, reason, honor, posterity, or property.” Felony is “every prohibited act done against a property or a person.” [Radd al-Muhtaar by Ibn `Abdeen]\nIbn Qudamah, a hanbilite scholar, defined it as “Every aggressive act whether against a property or a person.”\nThe definition of the jurists identifies the goal of prohibition, which is the protection of soul, property, honor, and reason. It establishes the theory of criminality without referring to the law but to the nature of the act in order to protect the five necessities without the protection of which the social system cannot be consistent.\nPunishment in the Islamic shari`ah\nThe punishment of the crimes has been accurately organized in distinguished groups according to the seriousness of the crime, the nature of the punishment, and the relation of the punishment to the affected side, be it an individual or the entire society.\nThey divided it into three kinds: retribution, hudud (sing. hadd, fixed punishments for certain crimes), and ta`zeerat (unfixed punishment administered at the discretion of the judge).\n1.                  Retribution is to do with the criminal as he did with the victim. It is often used for killing the killer, wounding the person who wounded another, and cutting off the same organ he cut off from the other. It is a punishment for every crime against body, soul, or organ. Retribution is the right of the victim. He can forgo it if he wills; or else he can get it. This is what is called the personal right, though the ruler still has the right to punish in another way.\n2.                  Hadd is a punishment prescribed as a right of Almighty Allah or of a human being and cannot be forgone except in cases of necessity or times of turmoil as al-Qurtuby stated. Such prescribed punishments are six, though there is difference of opinion concerning the penalty of accusing someone of illicit sexual intercourse, which al-Shafi`y regards as a personal right.\n3.                  Ta`zeer is a punishment not specifically prescribed by the shari`ah and becomes due, as a right for Almighty Allah or for a human being, for a committing a sin that usually has no prescribed hadd or an atonement. It is one of the rights of the ruler and he is authorized to estimate it, according to the opinion of the majority of the Malikites, the Shafi`ites and the Hanbilites and the correct opinion in the school of Abu Hanifah. But he can also forgo it. Thus, it depends, with regard to its execution or non-execution and its severity or alleviation, on bringing benefits and warding off harms.\nRights are distinguished. Sometimes the right is for Almighty Allah and can be called the right of the ruler as called by Ibn Rushd, the grandson; and this cannot be forgone if it is a hadd. Sometimes it is the right of a human being who can forgo it. Sometimes it wavers between the two sides and thus scholars differ over it. Sometimes the two rights overlap in the same case such as in the case when a muharib (someone who wages war against the Muslim community) takes someone’s property. There is another three-folded division based on how to identify the side of the right.\nPositive laws usually distinguish between the two sides: public right and personal right. On this they established the civil case filed by the affected person to demand compensation for the harm and the case of public right filed by the general persecutor to protect the society.\nBut, through detailing the kinds of crimes and penalties, the purified shari`ah has asserted the element of legislative consistency and stability represented in the shari`ah penalties which provide eternal protection to the universal necessities in a way that suits the eternal human necessity.\nIt also has laid emphasis on the side of flexibility, development, and adaptation with different environments in the form of ta`zeerat, not only through prescribing no maximum or minimum for the punishment but also through getting those in authority involved in executing or non-executing the punishment on the basis of seeking public interest not on the basis of mere whims.\nSome of the fair legists in the West noticed the element of consistency and stability and the element of flexibility and development in the shari`ah and thus they lauded it, as the Italian legist Dr. Onzicuanzabto did in his book “Islam and the policy of the Allies” in the first half of the twentieth century when he said, “The Islamic shari`ah is accurate and stable in form and nevertheless it suits the status quo. Its development does not diminish its value and effectiveness. For long centuries it has fully sustained its vitality and flexibility.”\nThe criminal justice system that balances between the right of the individual and the right of the community is what distinguishes the shari`ah from the Western systems that cry for the criminal and waste the right of the society with its thousands of individuals.\nThere is difference of opinion concerning the ethical outlook that begets law or that the law is supposed to serve. Besides, the theory of public order in the legal sense differs in the Islamic system from the Western one as we pointed out.\nIn addition to its strong concern about the safety of the society, the purified shari`ah provides firm guarantees for the individual not only through the principle of warding the punishment off in case of doubt, which applies to hudud; particularly with regard to crimes against ethics and the pure rights of Allah, but it also provided guarantees on the level of juridical procedures and the means of proving proofs. It has disallowed the judge to judge based on his own knowledge and sets as a condition that the witnesses have to be trustworthy and that their number has to be more than two in certain ethical issues. Moreover, it gives excuse to the accused person to discredit the witness when necessary. It prescribes taking oaths and in some cases makes it firmer. It disregards the confession of the person under coercion and only regards confession with free will and choice. It has also set special conditions for the person who assumes the post of a judge including knowledge, piety, honesty, and straightforwardness in addition to other conditions known in the writings on judiciary and judgeship.\nHaving presented the above divisions concerning the punishment and its demander, there is a third division based on the nature of the crime given by ibn Rushd, the grandson, in his bookBidayat al-Mujtahid where he divided it into five kinds: crimes against bodies, souls, and organs, crimes against chastity; crimes against properties; crimes against honor, crimes against shari`ah prohibitions concerning food and drink. He said that these are the crimes that have punishments prescribed by the shari`ah. I do not think that I need to delineate the rulings of crimes and the cases that necessitate hadd and the cases where ta`zeer is prescribed. I feel that mentioning the main principles suffices for mentioning the details and mentioning the definition suffices for giving descriptions and numbers; for all this can be known from the books of fiqh and Islamic rulings.\nIt is well known that the crime is a result of disobeying Almighty Allah and contravening His command, whether this is accompanied by committing an aggression against a human being or not. Any aggression against others is a disobedience to Allah but the opposite is not necessary. There could be an act of disobedience that involves no aggression against anyone else, such as leaving out an obligation and drinking alcohol. But, in fact, this protects the society through preserving upright manners without which violence prevails and malice grows.\nIn certain crimes severe punishment is prescribed; these are called “crimes that require the application of hudud“. In the shari`ah, we distinguish between crimes that require hudud and crimes that require ta`zeer. The former are limited and determined by the Lawgiver, while the latter are unlimited. The Lawgiver may provide a ceiling for the punishment, as in the case of the crime of highway robbery, and may not leaving it to the discretion of the judge to consider the conditions that require alleviating or toughening the punishment and to treat each case individually, as in the case of stealing stealthily a property whose owner did not keep it properly or seizing it by force, which is considered as a theft crime according to shari`ah jurists.\nMoreover, toughening the punishment was met by rigidity of the means to establish the proof as in some crimes- namely illicit sexual intercourse- four eyewitnesses are required. Moreover, if a person made a confession and then wanted to take it back or fled from the court, he should be left. Therefore, some scholars assert that the intent is to give threat only.\nWarning is a known principle even in the Western laws. Thus, the judge cannot judge on the basis of his knowledge, for personal conviction is not enough. There must be decisive means to establish the proof so that judge remains away from the claim of injustice. Thus, even if he saw a person stealing, he cannot issue a sentence against him unless with his confession or with a convincing witness.\nIn fact, the issue of criminalization is relative as Western jurisprudents admit.\nOn which basis an act could be considered a crime?\nThe elements of ethics, public order, and social denunciation constitute the basis of criminalization. In his book the Criminal Law: General Introduction, the French legist Jack Bradley admits the difficulty of defining crime in a social and ethical way saying, “Criminalizing an act results from the lawgiver’s conviction that this act is unforgivable by the public opinion and thus it deserves a tougher punishment.” He further said, “It is the right of the society to punish those who disturb its peace. Only few authors denied this, while the majority of philosophers admit the right of the community to make punishment.”\nTalking about ethics, he said, “There is an intimate relation between the ethical rule and the legal rule. The history of criminal law mostly shows that it is the conduct that shocks the good manners of the individual or the society that is punishable, such as committing a transgression against religion, life, or property.”\nThe French legist Tun Carison said, “Law and ethics can be drawn as two intersecting circles that have a common space and at the same time have special areas for each one of them.”\nThe author remarks that the law does not criminalize lying or things that are between the person and his Lord. He agrees with the social manners related to man’s duties toward his fellow beings, for unfulfilling them is criminalized by the criminal law.\nIn his book Criminal Law, DeCock said, “With regard to direct infringement of the social order, such as making transgression against religion or public affair, the reaction is associated with each society, be it a tribe or a state.” [p 26-27]\nHe further said, “The criminal law represents the society’s denunciation of the committed act, which justifies punishment.” The article (29) of the Human Rights Charter makes its application related to the consideration of ethics and public order. Thus, when we apply these punishments, we apply our ethics and respond to our societies that differ from other societies. Why then do they deny what they allow for themselves?\nA word remains concerning death sentence and life sentence. We may here borrow the words of Dr. Ibraheem al-Marzouqy who said, “Both death sentence, with the psychological horror it causes, and life sentence, with the bodily suffering it causes, are still applied in many countries. Accordingly, it could be said that the rule of ‘the minimum treatment of the prisoner’ has not been decided yet with regard to all kinds of tough punishment. It could be concluded that the criterion of ‘the minimum’ of legal punishment- in terms of lessening the psychological and bodily suffering for the punishable person- is not a real criterion because it does not provide enough deterrence to guarantee necessary security and protection for the society. The proof for this is the escalation, in kind and number, of the crimes committed in such countries that do not apply bodily punishments on the criminals. As such increase in crime means increase in the threat directed to the safety and stability of the society, those people have to choose between deterring punishments to defend public interest and sacrificing such interests and leaving criminals to destroy the society as they like. Hence, hesitancy expressed by some countries regarding the abolishment of bodily punishments can be justified by protecting the security of their peoples. No legal system can be accused of cruelty when it takes the side of public interest, because the benefit achieved by the law through this preference is far greater than some due harms of the punishment that the criminals suffer as a just result of what they committed.”\nIn another place of his book al-Marzouqy made a comparison between the results of applying the Islamic shari`ah and those of slacking in its application saying, “Therefore, we find that the rate of crime is dreadfully high in modern societies and thus the number of victims increases and so do the violations and contraventions of human rights. This in turn leads to diminishing the rights and restricting the freedoms that people should enjoy.”\nIn this context, it should be noted that the number of the cases of major crimes where hududare executed in the KSA, for example, is so little that it reflects the low rate of crimes; particularly when compared by the rate of committing such crimes in some other Muslim and non-Muslim countries.\nThe relative increase of the rate of crimes in the countries that slacken in the application of the Islamic shari`ah only indicates the weakness of the element of deterrence in the imposed punishments and the failure to apply the punishments that suit the danger of the crimes. In return for every crime committed, an individual or collective right is violated. Hence, when the application of the law deters the criminals, this safeguards rights and freedoms. This at least justifies such punishments that may seem apparently harsh.\nWhen the law fails in form, spirit, and application to achieve deterrence, it fails also to protect personal and collective rights and fails in turn to protect public interest. Accordingly, a question rises about the avail of such laws and systems and what need people have for its fuss? This applies to many of the modern laws and its successive crippling adjustments without significant benefit.\nThe Islamic legislation creates safe and stable societies that are sure to protect their rights, and this refutes the claims about the harshness of the Islamic penal system. If such allegations are not considered malicious, they are at least not based on objective basis.\nThe ultimate end and sublime goal of the criminal law is to reduce crime to preserve man’s rights of life and security, protect his property, and safeguard his posterity. These right have not been sufficiently observed in the positive criminal law, while the preservation of such rights is the criterion of its success.\nAs the Islamic legislation has unrelentingly combated any transgression against these rights through the application of severe punishments, it has also left some doors open for the perpetrators of some major crimes to make amends. This obviously indicates that the prescribed punishment aims basically at reforming the offender and the welfare of the society.\nThese doors, to which we shall indicate, represent the highest level of observing human rights, conforming with man’s nature and natural disposition, and respecting his privacy. They are:\nFirst: There is a rule that repentance remits some of the due hudud, as in the case of the punishment of hirabah (unlawful warfare), before arresting the criminal to exhort him to amend himself and to protect his blood and property. Almighty Allah said, “Except for those who return penitently before you gain power over them. Know, then, that Allah is most forgiving, mercy-giving.” [5:34] This is a legislative exoneration that a criminal can demand in court.\nAccording to some scholars, repentance remits the penalty of theft. In the view of some other scholars, it remits other penalties that are considered rights of Almighty Allah. But repentance does not remit people’s rights.\nRepentance has incomparable effect in the Islamic criminal law. It is a way paved by the Lawgiver to reform the society and to rehabilitate the deviant; for, through it, he can regain his civil rights.\nRepentance remits ta`zeer as well. Al-Qarafy mentioned, with regard to the difference between hadd and ta`zeer, that “Ta`zeer is remitted by repentance; I know no disagreement in this regard. But hudud are not remitted by repentance according the most correct opinion. Almighty Allah said, “Except for those who return penitently before you gain power over them.” (5:34)\nThough they agreed that the penalty of hirabah is remitted by repentance before arresting the perpetrator because Almighty Allah said, “Except for those who return penitently before you gain power over them”, scholars differed regarding the remission of hadd by repentance\nThe opinion of the majority is that it does not remit hadd. This is the position of `Ata’ and a group of scholars. But some of the Shafi`ites maintain that it does remit the hadd of theft because Almighty Allah said, “As for the male thief and the female thief, cut off their hands as a recompense for what they have earned, [and] as a chastisement of deterrence from Allah. And Allah is overpowering, all-wise. But whoever repents after his wrongdoing, and sets things aright, then, indeed, Allah shall grant him repentance.” [5:38-39] This opinion is attributed to al-Shafi`y; and other hudud were made analogous to it.\nAl-Qarafy summarized this analogy saying, “Disbelief is the greatest evil and hirabah is greater in evil than fornication. Nevertheless, these two great evils are remittable by repentance. Thus, that which affects the remission of a higher crime is worthier to affect the remission of a lower one. This is a strong question that supports the opinion that hudud should be remitted by way of repentance through making analogy with this agreed upon ruling as a fortiori.” Then he attempted to give answers for it.\nAl-Qurtuby said, “As for those who drink [alcohol], those who fornicate, and those who steal, if they have repented, set things aright, and become know for this and then they were brought before the ruler, he should not apply the prescribed penalty to them. But if they were first brought before him and then they claimed repentance, they should not be released.”\nIbn al-Qayyim said:\n“With regard to considering the repentance of the committer of hirabah before arresting him to the exclusion of other perpetrators, it should be said: Where is such discrimination in the texts of the Lawgiver? He rather explicitly mentioned the consideration of the repentance of the committer of hirabah before arresting him either to draw attention to the consideration of the repentance of others as a fortiori- for if repentance remits the penalty of hirabah in spite of the severity and transitivity of its harm, it is a fortiori that repentance should remit other lower penalties. Almighty Allah said ‘Say to those who disbelieve that if they desist [from disbelief], what they have done shall be forgiven them.’ [8:38]\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “Whoever repents from a sin is like the one who has no sin.” Almighty Allah has made hudud as punishment for those who commit crimes and lifted both shari`ah and fatal punishment from the repentant. There is no shari`ahor fatal punishment at all for a repentant. In Saheeh al-Bukhary and Saheeh Muslim we read the hadith reported by Anas who said, “I was with the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) when a man came to him and said ‘I committed a crime that deserves the application of hadd, so apply it to me’, and he (the Prophet) did not ask him about it. Then the Prayer was called for and he prayed with the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him). When the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) finished the Prayer, the man came to him and repeated his words, whereupon he said, ‘Have you not prayed with us?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘Indeed, Almighty Allah has forgiven you your sin.’”\nSo, as this person came declaring his repentance on his own without being summoned, Allah forgave him and the punishment of the crime he confessed was not applied to him. This is one of two opinions on this is issue and is one of the two opinions reported from Ahmad, and this is the correct one.\nIf it is said that Ma`iz and the Ghamidiyyah woman came to him and the punishment was applied to both of them, it will be said that there is no doubt that they came as penitent and there is no doubt that the penalty was applied to both of them and this was used as evidence by the proponents of the other opinion.\nI asked our sheikh about this point and the purport of his answer was that the punishment is a purifier of the sin and the repentance is a purifier. But these two persons chose to be purified through the penalty over being purified through repentance only and they refused but to be purifed with the hadd. So the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) responded to their choice. But he recommended the choice of being purified by repentance over being purified by the hadd. He said concerning Ma`iz, “Would you have left him to repent so that Allah may grant him repentance?” Were it obligatory to apply the punishment after repentance, it would not be permissible to let him go. The ruler has the choice either to let him go, as he said to the confessing perpetrator “Go; for Allah has forgiven you”, or to apply the penalty, as he applied it to Ma`iz and the Ghamidiyyah woman who chose to apply it and refused but to be purified through it. Therefore, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) sent them away many times but they refused except to have it applied to them. This approach is middle between the approach of those who maintain that it is not permissible to apply it after repentance at all and the approach of those who maintain that repentance has no effect at all on remitting it. If you reflect on the Sunnah, you will find it indicative of this middle position. Allah knows best.\nAs for the ahadith, there are many; and some of them apparently indicate generality with regard to the ethical crimes that include no personal right. Islam exhorts witnesses to conceal the affairs of the accused person and discourages taking cases to the court. In al-Muwatta’Malik reported that Hazal came and mentioned that a man committed fornication whereupon the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “O Hazal! Should you have concealed his affair, that would have been better for you.”\nTherefore, al-Kamal ibn al-Humam said, “It is undesirable to give testimony concerning a crime with a hadd penalty, because concealing such an affair is recommendable unless in the case of a person known for debauchery.”\nSecond: There is difference of opinion whether a non-Muslim is remitted from the punishment for ethical crimes that involve no personal right.\nIn his commentary, Ibn `Abdeen said, referring to Sharh al-Siyar, “He also mentioned that if amusta’man (non-Muslim who is given a pledge of security to reside temporarily in a Muslim country) in our lands has committed a punishable crime, he should only be punished for that which involves a right for a human being, such as retribution and the crime of accusing chaste people with fornication”.\nThis seems to be a sort of respect for his religious conviction, which makes him deem this deed lawful, and a fulfillment of the pledge of security. This is a degree of tolerance unfound in any positive law; namely, to give the foreigner more rights than the citizen.\nScholars have opinions and detailed discussions concerning this issue that should be revised in their references. Consequently, if the Islamic treatment is taken into consideration in terms of its comprehensiveness represented in not taking crimes to courts in principle, and the command to conceal such affairs, and the effect of repentance, and the difficulty of establishing the proof, the fuss raised about the harshness of Islam concerning crimes against ethics will change from finding it strange to finding it admirable and from shrinking to feeling honorable; and we will realize that the severe punishment is a threat to the criminal and a protection to the society.\nThere are quick clues to show how much the Islamic legislation surpasses the man-made laws with regard to being lenient to man, attempting to amend the criminal through repentance, and fighting dissolution in principle by fixing a threatening punishment that is applicable only in a rare and public case when the crime represents an aggression against the community.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Islam: Religion of Sincerity and Well-Wishing",
      "Answer": "\nDear Somali brothers… May peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you! Eminent scholars, jurists, and Du`ah (callers to Islam) called you more than one time to stop fighting. The last of these calls was the statement of the International Union of Muslim Scholars that urged you to put an end to war and incline to peace.Such statement made very clear the gravity of killing and combating quoting proofs from clearly decided texts of Qur’an and Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). We do not therefore need to repeat such texts here as you were supposed to show immediate positive response after you had been informed.\nAny way, we are aware that certain misconceptions are the reason behind your insistency on fighting. Therefore, we will discuss two of them in the light of Shar` (Islamic law) “… so that those who were to be destroyed (for their rejecting the Faith) might be destroyed after clear evidence, and those who were to live (i.e. believers) might live after clear evidence…” The two misconceptions in question relate to the non-application of Hudud (ordained punishments for violating Allah’s Law) by Sharif’s government and Al-Wala’ wal-Bara’ (loyalty and disassociation for Allah’s Sake) bearing in mind that the same government keeps relations with non-Muslim countries. In fact, such misconceptions provoked the sedition of takfir (declaring someone to be a disbeliever) and bloodshed in many Muslim countries.\nUnfortunately, this developed because of lack of comprehension and wrong analogy. Such situation is similar to that when Khawarij (separatist group that believed committing a major sin amounts to disbelief) said: “No judgment but for Allah” hence Amir Al-Mu’minin(Commander of the Believers) commented: “It is a true word but used to prove false allegation.” He said so as Khawarij put the right word in the wrong context. Regarding the first misconception mentioned above, we would like to assert that Shari`ah(Islamic law) covers very wide scope and comprehensive range. It comprises all obligations and prohibitions relating to different spheres of life as well as all sorts of good deeds which are meant for the well-being of Muslim individuals and their societies. Conforming to Shar` in the punishments’ field is a good deed. It is not only declared obligatory by Shar` but it is also desirable by human nature for it resists corruption. However, certain conditions have to be met for the application of Hudud:\nFirst: The availability of a stable and obeyed regime. This is because it is well-established thatHudud are to be applied by the ruler and people in power. In the absence of such constant authority, the application of Hudud is neither obligatory nor even permissible as Al-Qurtuby stated mentioning that Muslim scholars unanimously agreed on such ruling. Second: Having no fear of sedition or any religious trouble. A proof for this condition is the incident when `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) suspended the punishment of exile. Third: The non-existence of any doubtful matter that may ward off the application of Hudud, such as a famine etc., as `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) did during the year of scarcity. It is clear then that Islam is a complete system that considers people’s economic, social, security, and spiritual circumstances. Whoever does not perceive this fact cannot understand the reality of Shari`ah and its objectives which are based on facilitating matters and spreading glad tidings.\nOn the other hand, when a Muslim ruler does not apply Hudud though all the foregoing conditions are met; this does not take him out of Islam so long as he does not deny theShar`y (Islamic legal) obligation to apply Hudud. This is the view of verifying scholars who explained Allah’s saying (may He be Glorified and Exalted) in Surah (Qur’anic chapter) Al-Ma’idah: “… And whosoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, such are the Kafirun(i.e. disbelievers – of a lesser degree as they do not act on Allah’s Laws)” as referring to Kufr(disbelief) of a lesser degree and Fisq (rebellion and disobedience to Allah) of a lesser degree. This exegesis is given by Ibn `Abbas and Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with them both). Since not judging by what Allah has revealed does not take a person out Islam, it is not permissible to fight people only because they do so. In fact, Kufr is an act of heart that relates only to persons’ beliefs.\nAccordingly, it is reported that Hudhayfah and Ibn `Abbas said: “If a Muslim man does so ‘judges by other than what Allah has revealed’, this does not take him out Islam unless he disbelieves in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, or the Last Day.” The same is narrated from a group of Mufassirs (exegetes of the Qur’an) such as Tawus and `Ataa’. (book of Tamhid by Ibn `Abdul-Bar vol. 5 pp. 74-75).\nSimilarly, Shaykhul-Islam Ibn Taymiyah pointed out: “Ibn `Abbas and his companions mentioned that it is Kufr of a lesser degree, Zhulm (wrongdoing) of a lesser degree, and Fisqof a lesser degree. The same was said by Ahmad ibn Hanbal and other scholars of Ahl-ul-Sunnah (those adhering to Sunnah) as I will mention In sha’a-Allah (if Allah wills).” In addition, Shaykhul-Islam Ibn Taymiyah stated clearly the same with more details in his book Al-Fatawasaying: “Ibn `Abbas and his companions explained Allah’s saying ‘… And whosoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, such are the Kafirun (i.e. disbelievers – of a lesser degree as they do not act on Allah’s Laws)’ as referring to people that committed Kufr that does not take them out of Islam. The same was maintained by Ahmad ibn Hanbal and some other scholars of our Salaf (righteous predecessors).” Shaykhul-Islam Ibn Taymiyah also ascribed such view to Al-Bukhari. (book of Fatawa Ibn Taymiyah). Please see our book “Fatawa Fikriyyah“; chapter onTakfir. It is worth mentioning that we do not belittle the importance of applying Hudud. Rather, we aim only at giving issues proper explanations, calling to making peace and ceasing war, and consequently providing appropriate circumstances for the application of Hudud. This attitude is proven by the fact that Allah (may He be Exalted) did not punish people of Makkah when they combatted His chosen and most beloved servant Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Sahabah (Companions of the prophet), tortured, and drove them away their land as this would lead to harming innocent men and women. Allah (may He be Exalted) thus says: “… Had there not been believing men and believing women whom you did not know, that you may kill them, and on whose account a sin would have been committed by you without (your) knowledge, that Allah might bring into His Mercy whom He will, if they (the believers and the disbelievers) should have been apart, We verily had punished those of them who disbelieved, with painful torment.” How is it that you, O Somali brothers, wage a war in which you kill innocent men, women, and children on the plea of defending the truth?\nAs for the second misconception on the grounds of which you justify fighting the government, it is related to the principle of al-Wala’ wal-bara’ (loyalty and disassociation for Allah’s Sake). Such principle was also misused in a way that led to declaring people as coming out the fold of Islam because of false reasons and misunderstood generalities. In fact, the word wilayah(loyalty) and derivatives of mawla and waly are used in many contexts of Qur’an and Sunnah. The word waly thus signifies twenty one meanings among which are Ar-Rab (our Lord, may He be Glorified and Exalted), an owner, an emancipator, a relative, a neighbor, an uncle, a partner, a supporter, etc. According to Murtada Al-Zubaydi: “Most of these meanings were narrated in hadith(s). Therefore, each one of them is to be attached to what is related to thehadith in which it was mentioned.” To come to the point, wala’ (loyalty) is of different types and levels of which only wala’ based on`aqidah (creed) may take a person outside the fold of Islam. Infrequently, wala’ may be recommended such as wala’ to relatives including the non-Muslim ones for Allah says: “… And blood relations among each other have closer personal ties in the Decree of Allah (regarding inheritance)…” and the Prophet (peace be upon him) said to Asma’ (whose mother was a polytheist): “Connect ties with your mother.” Wala’ may also be prohibited such as wala’ that involves disobedience (to Allah) or assistance with murder.\nNevertheless, some sects through history interpreted wala’ incorrectly. Some prominent Sunnischolars warned against this, such as Imam Ahmad (may Allah be merciful with him) who said according to Al-Istakhry narration in Tabaqat Al-Hanabilah: “Wala’ ‘loyalty’ is bid`ah ‘innovation in religion’ and bara’ ‘disassociation’ is bid`ah…” `Abdullah ibn Ahmad elaborated widely on this inKitab As-Sunnah. Accordingly, it is not permissible to cling to the misconception of Al-Wala’ wal-Bara’ (loyalty and disassociation for Allah’s Sake) to justify fighting against the African forces which came to support Somalia under local and national resolution of Sharif government. (Since the Prophet mentioned that) “Protection given by the weakest Muslim to a disbeliever is generally considered,” how is it when such protection is given by a high official?! Fighting such forces is thus not permissible under all circumstances. Rather, you have to agree with them on the duration of their task and the limits of their competence. This will facilitate their withdrawal and enable you to dispense with them. So fear Allah, adjust all matters of difference among you, and do not declare one another disbelievers to create means to fighting “And all of you beg Allah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful.”\nThis is our advice to you and we are ready to engage in direct dialogue with you to clarify the truth concerning this matter as well as other issues. Besides, we call upon the government that was elected by influential people to resort to dialogue before resorting to fighting as `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) did with Khawarij (separatist group that believed committing a major sin amounts to disbelief). He held a dialogue and debated with them. He sent Ibn `Abbas to them and stopped fighting with them until they inflamed the community. We hope that Djibouti and Eritrea, who quartered people of Somalia when the Ethiopian army attacked them, may help them as well to unite and come together. However, they are sincerely thanked for the support, solidarity, and sincerity they showed to Somali people. In addition, we appeal to Somali scholars to spread this statement, revise it, correct it, and comment on it. Verily, we only seek the truth and aim solely at preventing bloodshed. We call upon all Somalis to work out an ambitious plan to protect their state against retardation, conflict, dissension, and influences of wars and destruction for doing so is the real jihad. It is noteworthy that Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyah stated that jihad encompasses all acts of righteousness as mentioned in the book of Alikhtyarat for Al-Ba`ly. The plan mentioned above may be conceived as combining different factions with the government and the parliament. Such a united body can then develop the organisational departments of the state on the basis of Allah’s shar` (law); its texts, objectives, branches, and principles. You have to draw up a plan for life, not death, as Allah says: “O you who believe! Answer Allah (by obeying Him) and (His) Messenger when he (SAW) calls you to that which will give you life…” It is the life that guarantees man’s happiness in this world and in the hereafter by promoting economics, bringing back the refugees to their homes, succouring the afflicted, and setting up well-trained human resources. The plan in hand may also codify systems that rely on forgiving and wide shari`ah (Islamic law).\nIt may adopt a foreign policy based on being a good neighbour, considering interests, and giving the two neighbouring republics of Djibouti and Eritrea a rank that suits the support and aid they showed to Somalia. It is a fact that all Arab, Muslim, and non-Muslim countries have their share in promoting peace and development including the possibility of concluding a nonaggression pact with Ethiopia who transgressed formerly. In addition, the armed forces may bring together all groups including young mujahids (those striving/fighting in the Cause of Allah), heroes among the Somali great generals, and pirates who will thus find it a good chance to serve their countries instead of the banditry they indulge in and who can be a part of the Somali marines until foreign fleets return to their military bases. You have thus to ascend to that level of cooperating with all entities including the superpowers that should examine their policies to constitute power of peace but not of destruction and wars. You proved your courage in fields of fighting and you have now to prove your wisdom in making peace and prosperity. Verily, Islam is a mercy to the whole universe. It is the religion of peace, love, and harmony. The Prophet (peace be upon him) thus commanded, as narrated by Ibn Ishaq, that a dog on the road had to be guarded so that the Muslim army would pass without harming it. How is it thus the gravity of harming Muslim and non-Muslim human beings?! I hope that you discuss all the ideas and notions mentioned above. We may also discuss them together once the chance comes up to affirm their compatibility with principles of shari`ah as well as political tendency that safeguards public interest which is one of the supreme objectives of shari`ah as Abu Ishaq Ash-Shatiby said: “Shari`ah is laid down only to safeguard people’s interests.” And upon Allah is the responsibility to explain the Straight Path. Verily, Allah (Alone) is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs (for us).

      "Answer": "\n(May 18, 2012) On Monday, ISNA joined Georgetown University’s Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (ACMCU) to host a Symposium on Religious Freedom and the Rights of Minorities in Islam in Washington, DC.  ISNA President Imam Mohamed Magid and ACMCU Assistant Director Dr. John Voll welcomed an audience of over 100 representatives of faith organizations, academic institutions, think-tanks, and foreign embassies.\nISNA is currently working together with Muslim leaders worldwide to promote a mechanism for developing Islamic standards and protocols on religious freedom and the role of religious minorities in the Muslim-majority communities.  A full video of the conference will be available next week but you can find highlights below.\nShaykh Abdallah bin Bayyah of Mauritania kicked off the symposium by providing the audience with background on the fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) of the rights of religious minorities in Muslim-majority communities.  The word “minorities” does not exist in Islamic thought, Sh. Bin Bayyah said, but rather multiple “religious groups.”  He added, “Islam sees humanity as one unified group,” quoting the Qur’anic verse, “O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another.”\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Islam: Religion of Love",
      "Answer": "\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful All praise is due to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon our Master, Prophet Muhammad, and upon his family and Companions. Love is one of the noblest human principles and traits that cultivate the spirit of interaction, solidarity, and cooperation and add affection to human relationships and dealings. All heavenly and manmade religions cherish love in its top-down (God-creation), bottom-up (creation-God), and horizontal (interpersonal) dimensions. Most notably, love is a central value in the teachings, literature, and practices of Christianity, as clearly stated in the Qur’an: {And We have placed in the hearts of those who followed him (i.e., Jesus) compassion and mercy}. In Qur’anic terminology, compassion and mercy are synonymous with love. That is why some Orientalists, such as Margaret Smith, alleged that the doctrine of Divine Love (which emerged at the turn of the first century A.H. with Sufi mystics like Al-Hasan Al-Basri, As-Suraymiyyah, Al-Fudayl, Rabi`ah Al-`Adawiyyah, and others) was largely inspired by Christianity. We believe that Islam is the origin of true love in all its dimensions (top-down, bottom-up, and horizontal) and forms, quite independent of any other faith, except inasmuch as both come from the same source, as established by historians. Many Qur’anic texts and Prophetic hadiths undeniably prove the fact that love, in the broadest sense, is an intrinsic ideal of Islam. Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali said, “Love of Allah is the highest spiritual attainment. Whatever follows it is an outcome of it (such as passion, communion, fulfillment, etc.), and whatever precedes it is a step towards it”. Allah says, {Say (O Muhammad), “If you really love Allah, then follow me, and Allah will love you”}. He also says, {A people whom He will love and who will love Him}. And He says, {But those who have believed love Allah more (than anything else)}. All such verses show the merit of love and tell that it has degrees. In several hadiths, the Prophet established love as a prerequisite to religiosity. Allah says, {And among people are some who would take (i.e., associate) besides Allah rivals (to Him) whom they love as much as they love Allah. But those who have believed love Allah most}. Ibn Jazi Al-Kalbi wrote, “There are two types of love: imitation love and hearty love. To me, the latter is indicated in the second Verse, while the former is indicated in the first Verse”.\nHeartfelt love is the greatest of loves. It brings forth ultimate satisfaction and happiness. A Companion once told the Prophet, “I have not prepared for it (i.e., the Hereafter) much Prayer or fasting, but I love Allah and His Messenger”. The Prophet said, “One will (in the Hereafter) be in the company of those he loves”. Anas commented, “I have never seen Muslims delight at something, except for conversion to Islam, more than they did at hearing this”. Abu Ruzayn Al-`Uqayli asked, “O Messenger of Allah! What is faith?” The Prophet replied, “It is to love Allah and His Messenger more than everything else”. The Prophet also said, “None of you shall truly believe unless when Allah and His Messenger are more loved to him than everything else”. And he said, “No servant of Allah shall truly believe unless when I become more beloved to him than his family, property, and all people”. Another narration adds, “… and his own self”. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) strongly urged for love. He said, “Love Allah for the graces He bestows upon you, and love me for Allah’s love for me”. An authentic hadith tells us that, while receiving the Shar`i penalty for being drunken, an alcoholic was cursed by a Companion. The Prophet blamed the curser, saying, “He (i.e., the penalized man) loves Allah and His Messenger”. Noticeably, though addicted to a sinful practice, the man still had something positive to commend: love. The deeper that love grows, the more deserved forgiveness becomes. A poet said, Indeed, my love for Umamah is not one That can be changed by tale-bearing or passage of time If this is true with romantic love, it will for sure be more applicable to love of Allah, the Sovereign, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, Who has granted us His Graces, originated us with His Wisdom, provided for us with His Generosity, and run our affairs with His Kindness. It pleases Him when a servant repents and returns to His Obedience, as pointed out in an authentic hadith. Allah says, {Indeed, Allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who are self-purifying}.\nHorizontal Love Mutual love among people is a basic notion in Islam, based on human fraternity. The Prophet said, “None of you shall truly believe unless when he loves for his brother what he loves for himself”. That hadith associates fraternity with love: “Brother” here means a fellow human, as interpreted by several hadith commentators, such as Ibn Rajab (Hanbali), An-Nawawi (Shafi`i), and Ash-Shabrakhiti (Malik). Also, there is “charity” — unlimited loving-kindness toward all others. The Prophet (peace be upon him) prayed, “Oh Allah! I ask you for (the ability to do) good deeds… and love for the poor”. In a Hadith Qudsi, Allah says, “And My servant will keep drawing closer to me by offering supererogatory acts of worship until I love him”. Love goes beyond living beings to include even nonliving things, nature, as well as good words and deeds. The Prophet described Mount Uhud saying, “This is a mount that loves us and is loved by us”. He further said, “Allah is Beautiful, and He loves beauty”. Allah loves to make things easy for people. The Prophet said, “Verily, Allah loves that His Exceptional Permissions be implemented”. Allah says, {And He (i.e., Allah) loves good-doers}. As early as his second speech after arrival at Medina, the Prophet focused on love, as documented by Ibn Ishaq. He said, “Love what Allah loves. Love Allah from the bottom of your hearts. Do not become weary of reciting Allah’s Words and extolments… Love one another with the spirit inspired by Allah among you. Verily, it angers Allah when His Covenant is broken. And peace be with you”. Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali said, “Let you know that the happiest of people in the Hereafter are those who love Allah most, because they will win the pleasure of meeting Him. The most blissful moment ever for a lover is when he meets his beloved after many years of longing, knowing that they will be together forever, without disturbance, restriction, or fear of separation. The pleasure depends on the degree of love: The stronger love is, the greater joy will be felt. Love of Allah is acquired in life and is found in every believer, because it comes from knowledge of Allah. However, when love grows so overwhelming that it turns into some sort of infatuation or extravagant passion, this elevated status is not found in most people”.\nLove is a human value. Everyone likes to be loved; hardly can there be someone who finds it ok to be hated by others. Someone can clash with others because they do not love him. He is reacting the wrong way; if love is shown by both sides, there will remain no hostility. Love involves feelings and behavior; it should be manifested in word and deed. The Prophet said, “When one of you loves his brother, let him inform him of this”. Why is love a value? Because it is seen as good by everyone, even those who do not have it. This is the criterion for value. Philosophers used various terms to refer to inner pleasure, such as “love of fate”, a term used by Nietzsche to describe an attitude in which one sees everything that happens in one’s life, including suffering and loss, as good. Moreover, it is characterized by an acceptance of the events or situations that occur in one’s life. Another example is “intellectual love of God”, a concept put forward by Spinoza to describe the highest good with which we attain “our salvation and blessedness and freedom”. It originates from God’s eternal and infinite essence. It is, then, simply one particular mode of God’s attribute. Intellectual love is also one part of God’s love for himself. This does not mean that intellectual love is eternal, but it signifies that essence of the human mind can be explained in the light of God’s eternity. Now, how to solve the issue of misrepresenting Islam and Muslims? And how to restore Islam’s true image of love and purity? If our religion kindles the flames of love for all humanity, how come we let its image be distorted due to some ignorant followers and lying enemies? Paradoxically, Islam is depicted as a religion of hatred, while the Prophet of Islam said, “Do not hate one another, do not turn your backs to one another, do not raise prices (in business bargains) for one another, and be brothers, O servants of Allah”. How to embody such tridimensional love in our behavior, discourse, and relations? And how to represent it in a friendly and likable manner despite false allegations from opponents?\nWe should address a horde of misconceptions that form an ideological barrier to mainstreaming Islam and Muslims worldwide, such as relations with non-Muslims, which must be based on mutual acceptance, respect, and peacefulness. Another issue to deal with is the concept of Islamic jihad, which is taken by many either excessively or slackly. What does jihad mean lexically and technically? And what justification it has in the Qur’an? In Arabic usage, jihad is the “exertion of the utmost effort to achieve something that is probably desirable”. Religiously, jihad has three types, as identified by Ar-Raghib in Al-Mufradat (The Items): (1) jihad against a plain enemy, (2) jihad against Satan, and (3) jihad against one’s own self. The last two types are implied in several hadiths. For example, Imam Ahmad in his Musnad and Abu Dawud in his Sunan reported Fudalah Ibn `Ubayd as narrating that the Prophet said, “A true mujahid is the one who strives against his own self in obedience to Allah, the Almighty”. In a weak hadith reported by Al-Bayhaqi, Jabir narrated that, upon return from his last conquest Tabuk, the Prophet said, “We have returned from the minor jihad to the major jihad”. He interpreted it as meaning to resist one’s whims. In fact, taking care of one’s parents is a sort of jihad. The Prophet said, “Then let your taking care of them be your jihad”. Ibn Taymiyyah defined jihad saying, “It encompasses all sorts of worship, inward or outward, including love of Allah, devotion to Him, reliance on Him, submission of one’s soul and property to Him, patience, asceticism, and continuing remembrance of Him. It takes all possible forms — physical, spiritual, mental, verbal, etc.”\nWala’ & Bara’ The issue of Wala’ (loyalty to whatever belongs to Islam) and Bara’ (renunciation of whatever contradicts with Islam) is widely used in the literature of Takfir (i.e., accusation of blasphemy or unbelief) movements, which generalized it to encompass economic, commercial, political, military, and security relations with countries that cherish peace, provide technology, and promote development. In fact, the concept of Wala’ and Bara’ has to do with partisanship in the domain of creed or faith — that is, it depends whether one is believer or unbeliever. However, interaction with non-Muslims within the context of everyday dealings, good relations, and peaceful coexistence is not objectionable. The notion and fatwas of Takfir are unduly exaggerated. They contradict with the Islamic culture of peace, whose basics are found in many Islamic texts. For example, Allah says, {Allah does not forbid you from those who have not fought you due to religion}. He also says, {And say to people good words}. The Prophet said, “Keep dutiful to your (non-Muslim) mother”. He also said, “And say greetings to those you know and those you do not know”. And he said, “And treat people with kindness”. Other examples include the hadith on Hilf Al-Fudul (i.e., Alliance of the Virtuous), the Charter of Medina, the permission for Christians to perform their prayers at the mosque, and many other traditions, which range from authentic to good to weak. Broadly, they imply specification of the generalization, permitting dealings with non-Muslims as may be necessary for people’s benefit and, at the same time, warding off harm and evil by regulating the applicable contexts and outcomes. In fact, improving the image of Muslims is a basic Shar`i objective, as indicated by the questions of building the Kaaba on the same bases founded by Abraham and abstention from killing the hypocrites. The subject at hand is open for further study and contemplation, and the above is just a brief discussion on the culture of consolidated values, which can make the world a better place where love prevails and war comes to an end.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Islam Is Not an Unsheathed Sword",
      "Answer": "\nIn this article we are going to point out one of the Islamic rulings concerning the concept of jihad and its practical applications.\nJihad could be a military action. There are military actions that are not jihad. Ibn Khaldun divided wars into four kinds according to their motives. He said that the origin of all wars is the desire of revenge. But two kinds of wars are transgression and turmoil: competitive war (expansive war) and transgressive war waged by brutal nations.\nThe other two kinds are just wars: one waged out of anger for the sake of Almighty Allah and His religion, which is the meaning of jihad, and the other waged against those who rebel against authorities, which is a war to safeguard the kingship as he called it.\nIn fact, the concept of jihad in Islam is not always synonymous with fighting. Jihad has a wider concept. It is a sort of defending the truth and a call to it. This is the first meaning. Almighty Allah said in the chapter of al-Furqan “Persevere in impelling them with this [Quran], with a mighty impelling”; that is, establish the compelling arguments and present to them the proofs one after the other. Obviously, reciting the Quran does not involve military actions. Hence, not every jihad is fighting and not every fighting is jihad. Jihad is also a call for freedom.\nA group of people claimed that Islam is an unsheathed sword and a ready spear. But whoever revises the occasions of revelation and the history of the dispute between Islam and its enemies can understand that there is no contradiction between the verses that encourage fighting, such as the verse “Fight the idolaters, all together, just as all of them fight you. And know that Allah is with the God-fearing” which came down in the context of existing war, and the verses that define the purpose of fighting as defensive. Verses cannot be taken out of their universal contexts as Orientalists and their students attempt to do.\nUsing this logic Christianity can also be considered as a religion of war if we are to judge on the basis of verse 24 in Mathew chapter 10, which attributes to Jesus (peace be upon him) that he said “Do not think that I came to cast peace on earth. I did not come to cast peace but rather a sword.”\nWar in Islam is defensive, not to force people to embrace the religion. In a treaties about fighting Ibn Taymiyyah said “Regarding the wars that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) engaged in with disbelievers (29 battles), it was the disbelievers who transgressed or were the direct or indirect cause. This asserts that the basic principle with disbelievers is peace not war. Were war the original principle, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) would start fighting with them. The overwhelming narrations concerning his life reveal that he did not start fighting with anybody.”\nThus, jihad is defensive, according to Ibn Taymiyyah. This is what many Qur’anic verses indicate giving the compelling the reasons. One of them is injustice represented in expulsion from home and restriction on religious freedom “Permission is given to those who are being fought because they have been wronged.” Exegetes consider this verse as the first one concerning fighting. In his book on the Prophet’s biography, Ibn Hisham said about the occasional reason for sending it down: Before al-`Aqabah Pledge of Alliance, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) was not permitted to wage war or shed blood. He was only commanded to call to the way of Allah, have patience with hurt, and pardon the belligerent. Quraysh had so oppressed his fellow émigrés testing their religion and expelling them from their countries that they had turned to be either oppressed for their religion, tortured at their hands, or fugitives in other countries. Some of them were in Ethiopia, others in Medina, and others elsewhere.\nWhen Quraysh defied Almighty Allah, refused the honour he intended to give them, belied His Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), tortured and expelled those who worshipped Him, professed His oneness, believed His Messenger, and kept hold to His religion, Almighty Allah gave permission to His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) to fight them and take revenge from those who wronged and oppressed them. Thus, the first verse sent down concerning giving permission for him to engage in war, shed blood, and fight those who oppressed them was, according to reports that reached me on the authority of `Urwah ibn al-Zubay along with other scholars, the saying of Almighty Allah “Permission is given to those who are being fought because they have been wronged. And indeed, Allah is omnipotent to give them victory. These are the ones who have been expelled from their homes without any right, for nothing more than saying: Our Lord is Allah! For had Allah not [decreed to] repel some people by means of others, demolition would certainly have come to hermitages, and churches, and synagogues, and mosques, in which the name of Allah is much mentioned. Yet, most surely, Allah shall support whoever supports Him. Indeed, Allah is most surely all-powerful, overpowering. These are the ones who – when We set them [in authority] over the land – they establish the Prayer, and give the Zakah – charity, and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong. Yet to Allah belongs the ultimate end of all affairs.”\nThis means: I only permitted fighting for them because they – namely, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and his companions (may Allah be please with them all) – were wronged while they did nothing wrong to people except that they worshipped Allah, established Prayer, gave out Zakah – charity, enjoined good, and forbad evil.\nThe other reason is to save and aid the helpless. This is indicated by a verse in the chapter of al-Nisa’ (the Women) that reads “Then what is with you that you do not fight in the path of Allah, and for the helpless among the men and the women and the children who say: Our Lord! Bring us out of this city whose people are wrongdoers. And appoint for us, from Yourself, and ally. And appoint for us, from Yourself, a supporter.”\nThe third reason is to drive back aggression as in the chapter of al-Baqarah (the Cow) “And fight in the path of Allah all those who fight you. But do not commit aggression. Indeed, Allah does not love those who commit aggression.” This verse was considered by Ibn Jareer as the first verse concerning fighting. It means that you are not to wage war against your enemy, but you have to drive back their aggression in the cause of Allah because you thus defend yourself and you will be right because you have been wronged.\nIn this context of resisting aggression and stopping the wrongdoer without excess, (we consider these verses): “But as to those who defend themselves, after having been wronged, there is no cause [for blame] against them. But the rightful cause shall be only against those who wrong people and who commit injustice in the land without any right. It is these who shall have a most painful torment. But, most surely, one who remain patient and who forgives [great shall be his reward]; for indeed these are among the commandments of [Allah that must be kept with] diligent resolve.”\nIn the last two verses we notice commending patience and tolerance after giving permission to drive the aggression back.\nThis war is subject to all the criteria of virtue. It is to drive back aggression without excessive use of violence. The weak should be aided and religious freedom should be respected. There are strict rules concerning the preservation of civilians, weak people, workers, villagers, clergymen, and women.\nFruitful trees and animals should be safeguarded; no forest should be burnt, no civilians should be hurt, treaties should be honestly respected even if they seem unfair sometimes. It is a clean war with one leadership. It is not a bloody game where the army kill, loot, and assault as they like. It is a necessary war. In contemporary terms, it is a war supported by the international law, the international treaties, and the United Nations Charter, particularly article 51.\nThe 5th article of the NATO agreement states: “Parties of the agreement consider that any military attack against any of them in Europe or North America to be against all parties. If this happens, they regard that each party has the legitimate right to defend itself individually or collectively as acknowledged by the 51st article of the Charter of the United Nations. Each party should help the other individually or through the agreement of all parties.” So many are the false conceptions about Islam! These will be the subject to the next article, by the help of Allah.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Islam Is a Religion of Compassion",
      "Answer": "\nIn the aftermath of 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, a strong humanitarian response was prompted all around the globe to provide aid for the survivors and offer condolences to the hard-hit countries for the heavy death toll they incurred. This was all normal and “human”. Sympathy is inherent in us. At some point, man inevitably feels belonging to this world and senses that the life or death of one person is equal to the lives or deaths of all people. This is the essence of life and death: It is not a matter of magnitude; life is life, and death is death, regardless of who, when, and how many. This fact is emphasized in the Qur’an: {Whoever kills a soul not (in punishment) for (killing another) soul or out of spreading corruption in the earth it shall be (reckoned) as though he has killed all people. And whoever saves its life it shall be (reckoned) as though he has saved the lives of all people}. That worldwide response was rather an awakening of the human conscience, which had sadly turned apathetic after the many and many atrocities committed by man on earth, {sowing corruption and shedding blood} as the Qur’an puts it. While censuring such insensitivity, ruthlessness, and use of lethal weapons that mark today’s world, it is our duty to commend that internationally concerted efforts in solidarity and sympathy with the victims, inspired by moral and religious ideals. In particular, Islam requires benevolence not only towards Muslims but actually towards every human, or even living, being. In an authentic hadith, the Prophet said, “In every creature with a moist liver (i.e., every living animal) there is a reward”. This splendid metaphor implies that every living being deserves care and help to keep the divine gift of life. Simply the fact that a creature has a liver makes it eligible for mercy and compassion. Cats, whales, humans, and all species are the fellow inhabitants of this world. Contrary to the mainstream notion, religious differences never prevent mutual sympathy at times of crisis or when a calamity befalls. Once, the Prophet saw a Jewish funeral procession, and as a sign of condolence, he stood up. When his Companions told him that the deceased was non-Muslim, he commented, “Is not it a soul?!” By doing so, the Prophet was teaching us that respect for the human soul and pity for the sufferers are not limited to the followers of Islam but extend to all people. In line with the teachings of our compassionate and tolerant religion, we Muslims are expected to embody such noble values and virtues and show solidarity with the victims, Muslims and non-Muslims. This is the very message of us and of all heavenly religions, from Prophet Adam to Prophet Muhammad.\nSolidarity within the human community is the first lesson to learn from the disaster — a lesson that should create a deep understanding of the nature of relation between the dwellers of this planet as one family. To be credible, this requires reconsideration of how the world is managed, to put it on more solid moral grounds. Needless to say, the world has become like a huge jungle where beasts ferociously fight and where selfish benefit, blind force, and “the more you kill, the more welcomed and respected you are” constitute the prevailing code of conduct. In such a havoc, international law and covenants are worthless, illogicality is the norm that the human mind must accept, and masters of war are spreading the culture of killing everywhere. As an Arab poet wrote, We live in such an insane time when Whoever does not go insane is not deemed sane Does this solidarity apply to the victims of manmade disasters? This question is asked to man, to the “big pirates” and the “small pirates”. Natural disasters are inevitable incidents in this mortal universe, created and predestined with ultimate wisdom by the Maker of this universe. The 2004 earthquake is not the first and will not be the last. It is a fact of life, just like life and death, health and illness, youth and senility, sleeping and awakening, summer and winter, heat and coldness. This planet and its inhabitants are subject to the ups and downs of life. We must respect our world, which is our home, our host, our abode. Allah says, {Then (there is) habitation (for you upon the earth), and then a repository (in the grave). Truly, We have made the signs utterly distinct for a people who can understand}. In fact, this earth is like a mother for us, as it is wherefrom we come to life and whereto we will return. Allah says, {From it have We created you, and to it shall We return you, and from it shall We bring you forth another time}. That home is unprecedentedly violated by the greedy from among its inhabitants. The nonrenewable resources are excessively consumed, the nature is gravely polluted due to industrialization, climate changes are going on rapidly, sea ice is melting, the phenomenon of “greenhouse effect” is looming large, and toxic waste spreads everywhere contaminating even the depths of oceans. Virtually, Allah says, {Corruption has prevailed in the land and the sea because of (all the evil) that the hands of people have earned}. We need to make a new start with our environment. This is the second lesson: to relink to the heaven. Astounded by the terrible calamity and wondering about its reasons, one asks two types of questions, some legitimate and some illegitimate.\nThe first type relates to studying the physical laws. Why did the earthquake occur? How to predict earthquakes? How to design quakeproof buildings? Where to live safe from seismic activity? These questions do not conflict with the acknowledgment of the Lord’s Power and Will. As Caliph `Umar Ibn Al-Khattab said, “We are fleeing from something predestined by Allah to something predestined by Allah”. The other, illegitimate, questions are such type that involves blame to Allah, Exalted be He, under their own laws. Why did our Lord do that while He is the All-Merciful? This manifests sheer ignorance of the ultimate Wisdom of Allah, the Almighty, the All-Wise: {He shall not be questioned as to what He does, while they shall be questioned}. Allah allows such disasters to happen to make humanity feel how weak it is and to warn it against deviation. Allah says, {He is the One Who shows you lightening to inspire (in you) fear and hope}. They are also meant to arouse people’s conscience to repent to Him. The prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “The sun and the moon are two of Allah’s signs. They never go into eclipse for the death or for the life of anybody. Thus, when you see them (undergoing eclipse), have recourse in Prayer”. People should resort to supplication and repentance from sins, for a disaster may be a form of punishment. Allah says, {And not a single affliction strikes you but that it is for what your own hands have earned, and He pardons much}. It may also be a classification, as in the hadith: “And a drowning person is a martyr”. Or it may be a reminder of the ultimate end of this universe. Allah says, {When the earth quakes with its (utmost) quaking}. Returning to virtue, establishing justice, stopping destruction, shunning selfishness and arrogance, and creating a global system underpinned by morality and ideals are the best ways to alleviate the impact of natural disasters on humanity and to “moralize” the international system around ethics advocated by religion and good human disposition, rather than such immorality and queerness associated with false modernity and civilization. Perhaps the biggest lesson to derive from the incident is that humanity should become all aware of three basic facts: 1. All people are members of one global family and must cherish solidarity and cooperation. 2. The Earth is the global home that everyone must love and take care of. 3. Man is weak before Divine Power and needs virtue to beautify and optimize his life in this world. To conclude, this article is not meant to attack or condemn the global system. It is just a discussion of the facts and a presentation of advice, for whoever {listens with heed}.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Islam Forbids Extremism",
      "Answer": "\n“Subaygh sought knowledge but he went in the wrong way.” These words were ordered by `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) to be proclaimed regarding a person who was given disciplinary punishment for rising deviant questions that could stir doubts and sow misguidance in the hearts of the believers. What then should be the case with regard to a group that spread death and destruction in Muslim countries? If they speak in the name of Islam and jihad, they have gone astray and have taken the way of hirabah, baghy, and sowing corruption in the land. These are the three crimes committed by this group of people and can be classified under different crimes according to the shari`ah. Hirabah stands for highway robbery and the use of weapons to exploit people, whether Muslims or non-Muslims who live under covenant with Muslims. The Malikites have deemed it sufficient for this crime to spread horror in such a way that one becomes unable to seek help in streets, narrow alleys, or houses. These are crimes against the society or public crimes; and therefore the verse described such acts as waging war against Allah and His Messenger to make their acts despicable and to condemn their misbehaviour. He said “Assuredly, the recompense of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger…..” [5:33] There is one observation here. The punishment of this crime is left to the ruler to decide the suitable punishment from among the explicitly stated penalties. The second observation is that the individuals who suffered from the crime of these people do not have the right to forgo the penalty, because the issue is entirely in the hands of the ruler. Obviously, the crime of hirabah applies to the acts of these terrorists. The second crime is the crime of baghy where a group of people with military ability rebels against the ruler on the basis of some interpretation of shari`ah texts. This is the definition of most of the scholars.\nThe Malikites, however, do not deem it a condition that they should be a group of persons- the crime could be done by one person. It is not also a condition that he should be adopting a particular interpretation. Khaleel, a Malikite scholar, said: “Bughah (those who commit the crime of baghy) are a group of people who disagree with the ruler to prevent a duty or to topple him.” His commentators said that the word “group” is not meant to exclude other possibilities. One person will be considered baghi (singular of bughah) if he rebels against the ruler. The nature of rebellion: Is it a must that they should have attacked people’s properties or persons or have agreed to overthrow the ruler? Or is it enough that they just declare rebellion even if they do not actually threaten public security? This is last point of view is the one adopted by al-Ramly, a Shafi`ite scholar, who said: Their mere existence gives rise to evil consequences that may not be avoided as long as they have rebelled against the authority of the ruler and prepared themselves to fight. (Nihayat al-Muhtaj 7:386.) Almighty Allah said: “But if one of them commits injustice against the other, then fight the one that commits injustice until [that group] reverts to the rule of Allah.” The third crime is their sowing corruption in the earth. The Malikites have built many branched rulings on this crime without setting an all-inclusive and all-exclusive definition for it – such as deeming it lawful to shed blood, taking people’s property, and declaring others as disbelievers; even if one has not actually done anything that threatens public security. (See Tabsirat al-Hukkam by Ibn Furhoun) In the West culture, the definition of terrorism is not far from these meanings. Taken from its original source, it is defined by Roubir French Handbook Dictionary as: A current of thought that constantly adopts exceptional violent measures to reach political goals. It is also a set of violent acts, aggression, destruction etc carried out by a political organisation to instil fear in people and create an atmosphere of terror. The terrorist is the one who is a member in an organisation of this kind.\nLa Rous French Dictionary defines it as a set of violent activities committed by an organisation to create an atmosphere of terror or to topple the regime. If this is the description of this deviant and rebelling group who commit three of the most heinous crimes in Islam, they also adopt three manners condemned and denounced by the shari`ah; namely, extravagance, extremism, and over-strictness. Islam forbid over-strictness as in the hadith narrated by Anas “Do not be over-strict so that Allah should not make things harder for you.” Islam forbids extremism in religion which means going to extremes. In a hadith narrated by Ibn `Abbas, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “Beware of extremism in religion, for those before you underwent destruction for their being extremist in religion.” It also forbids extravagance which, just like extremism, is to exceed the limits in words and deeds. In a hadith narrated by Ibn Mas`oud, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said three times “Perished be those who are extravagant.” These three terms signify a state of being away from moderation in thoughts and sayings, which is contrary to the moderate approach and leads to, bigotry, and mischief. These terms are synonymous to extremism and fundamentalism. Three authorities: As for the three authorities that are directly responsible for prevention and cure, they are the family, educational institutions, and media. Family is the first incubation that affects the behaviour of the young. It thus has a significant role in providing good education that protects its sons against intellectual and behavioural deviation. It is known that the intellectual concepts are the motives that turn soon to be practical behaviour. Family is greatly responsible for fixing the defects and filling the intellectual gap which the youth suffer from in the age of globalisation and the influx of exciting and thrilling information that drains minds, causes crimes, and magnifies the culture of murder and fight.\nFamily should teach its children how to distinguish between truth and falsehood, darkness and light. Here I recall two words by two rightly guided caliphs describing the state of mischief when eyes turn blind. When the masses revolted against `Uthman ibn `Affan (may Allah be pleased with him), Commander of the believer, he said “The falsehood has made them see as a devil.” This means that the falsehood has overcome the minds of these people and thus they saw their caliph as a devil and revolted against him. The second word is by Abu Bakr, the first caliph of the Messenger of Allah, (may Allah be please with him) who said “O guide! Either the dawn or the darkness.” He said so at his death when he feared lest people might deviate from obeying the one to whom he entrusted caliphate. He meant: O you who guide people! There is nothing before you except light or darkness. Family has a great role in the process of prevention and cure when it feels that the son shrinks from the society. Then it has to guide him to the correct way and to seek help from specialists to treat his case before it is too late and before he is lost in the corridors of darkness. Educational institutions have an effective role in crystallizing the concepts that lay the foundation of individual and collective will. The more positive, effective, and pioneering these institutions are, the more they will be able to graduate generations of pioneers and of positive and rational individuals and the more their students will acquire intellectual and psychological immunity. The more failure the educational process suffers and the more defects it has in presenting proper thought and correct information, the more loss and failure their graduates will experience. This will make them more liable to accept deviant ideas and to engage in criminal activities and futile practices. The educational system from elementary level to university along with technical institutes has a responsibility and task; namely, the task of communicating with the psychology and emotion of the student. The spectacle of an introverted student who does not pose a question or give an answer and who – in the best cases – copies at exams the books without analysis may make the teacher feel the easiness of being free from the strain of dialogues. But this bears the danger of graduating youth intellectually unprotected and weak before the temptation of deviant ideas.\nThe third side: This is the national journalism written, audio, or visual. This side is concerned with daily treatment of events to present, comment on, explain, clarify, and direct them. It plays a decisive role because news has become like daily meal for people. But the situation with regard to national journalism is so difficult owing to the torrent influx of information that broadcasts good and evil, falsehood and truth. This is a mixture that leaves the recipient to live in a whirlwind of depression, and sometimes of fallacies. But the intelligence of the journalist, his sincerity to his religion, his nation, his abilities, his talents, and his experience enable him to deal with the audience and to secure success in the ruthless media competition…. In sum, these three sides in addition to the pulpit in mosques and intellectual symposiums in cultural clubs, can form a synchronous system of multiple means and tools that have one goal and one end to provide the correct message and the proper concepts to the minds of the youth in order that their behaviour becomes correct, their inclination becomes moderate, and their misguided ones become guided. This is the bet we ought to win so that the Ummah should win and the youth should succeed. Finally, there are two referential authorities: one of them is the fiqh academies and fatwa institutions which have to refute such deviant ideas and extreme behaviour with argument and proof and to rebut the false fatwas and sophistry of unknown muftis. The second authority is the institutions whose role in this issue does not differ from their role in all other criminal issues. Their role is to protect the society from crime and criminals by looking for criminals, collecting information about crimes, and bringing criminals to courts. Finally, perhaps what I mentioned in this paper is not unknown or absent from minds, but it serves to call upon a misguided person to go right, upon a sick person to seek cure, and upon a sound person to be on guard “And remind [them]. For, indeed reminding benefits the believers.” Almighty Allah is the One who grants success; and He is all-worthy of reverent fear – and all-worthy or [granting] forgiveness.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Inviting Non-Muslim Friends to Wedding",
      "Answer": "\nPeace and blessings be upon you, together with the mercy and blessings of Allah. Your eminence Sheikh! I work in a big company and I have good and respectable relations with many people from different religions and sects (Shi`ites, Christians, …). I will be married soon; and my question is about inviting them to my wedding and whether this involves showing alliance to them. I want to find a solution to this embarrassing problem in a way that conforms to the Shari`ah. Peace be upon you together with the mercy and blessings of Allah.\nAll praise is due to Allah alone. Peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah. And upon you be peace, together with the mercy and blessings of Allah. With regard to the wedding feast, is it permissible for him to invite those whom he deems as deviating from the truth or those who are not Muslims. The issue is broad if there is a need or necessity to invite these persons – such as to avoid severance of relations, rancor or hatred, or to bring a benefit that will set things aright. The evidence for this is the report mentioned by Ibn Hisham, Ibn Sa`d, and other scholars of the Prophet’s biography that, by the end of the three days he stayed in Mecca to perform `Umrah according to his agreement with Quraysh, men from Quraysh (Ibn `Amer and Ibn `Abd al-`Uzza) came to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) asking him to leave quickly, according to the agreement. He said to them, “What wrong will fall on you if you allow me to make my wedding among you and to make food to serve you when you attend it.” [Reported by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak (6796) on the authority of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him)] This was an invitation from the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) to the idolatrous people of Mecca to attend the wedding feast he would make because of his marriage to Maymonah (may Allah be pleased with her). This is the basic principle if there is a benefit or need that one should deal with non-Muslims or with persons toward whom he has a particular attitude.\nAccordingly, I say that the issue is broad and we have mentioned the evidence. Three opinions were reported from Imam Ahmad concerning this issue, as mentioned in Al-Insaf, and the third one mentions the permissibility of congratulating, offering condolences to non-Muslim, and visiting the sick among the non-Muslims, if there is a benefit from this. This was also chosen by Ibn Taymiyyah. Thus, if there is a benefit, this makes things easier and also allows him to invite these people to his wedding feast without feeling uneasy. Allah knows best.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Introducing global center for renewal and guidance",
      "Answer": "\nBy Dr. Mozammel Haque Saudi Gazette\nRECENTLY, peace-loving people of the world have started thinking about how to heal the scars created after the 9/11 incidents in the United States. They are thinking how religion can play a role to solve some of the crucial political, economic, social and environmental issues facing the world through the joint and coordinated efforts of the followers of the world religions.Recently, two international centers have been established to realize these goals: Global Center for Renewal and Guidance (GCRG) and the Tony Blair Faith Foundation in the United Kingdom. Introducing the Global Centre for Renewal and Guidance, it was registered last year as a charity organization in the United Kingdom. Dr. Abdullah Omar Naseef, Chairman of the Centre, told me in an interview, “About two/three years ago we felt the need to improve our curriculum in our universities, as we found that the quality of graduates coming out of Shariah and other religious institutions in the Muslim world, was not up to the mark, they don’t have the inclusive and comprehensive perception of Islam.”“Islam is comprehensive and includes every aspect of life. We thought about Islamization of knowledge and Islam as a curriculum,” said Dr. Naseef and mentioned the Islamization of Knowledge movement which was initiated from Makkah Al-Mukarramah in 1977 through the First World Conference of Muslim Education followed by five or six World Conferences on Muslim Education.“But nothing much has been accomplished as yet. So we thought that we start the process of educating people by the establishment of an institute in Britain. We realized after studies that the scheme would be very expensive and needed contribution from the government which is not possible,” said Dr. Naseef.Dr. Naseef said, “We thought that we should start courses in training of the imams, impart to our students the values of the Middle Way of Islam; the balanced religion and also train them on the schools of thought. The students may be all regions of the world who could study and live together. The first meeting was held in Wales last year, in 2007. We brought people from America mainly with some from Britain of different backgrounds, who stayed together for three or four days, and we succeeded in teaching them that we all could work together in harmony.”Elaborating, Dr. Naseef said, “When we study the outcome of our experiment in Wales we found that we were going in the right direction. So we thought we should register our institution and try to prepare our courses. After long discussions, we thought that it was worth while to set up institution of this kind to undertake research and training courses; publication of books to help in understanding the greatness of Islam and its comprehensiveness.Sheikh Abdallah, one of the core members of our team, has produced the book on “The Manufacturing of Fatwa.” How does one make Fatwa? What are the conditions? The courses delivered in Wales were concentrated on that. The Center has been officially opened here in the United Kingdom.”Dr. Naseef said, “We are getting together for a noble cause to bring law and order, to bring people to wisdom and peace, to compassion and virtues, for which Prophets were sent. God has sent down Prophets with the clear message and Mizan. There is a balance which keeps the things in order. People should learn from that; they should come to the virtue; the virtue that will make them better human beings, bring them together to a coherent society in a global village.”Speaking about the Center’s objectives, Dr. Naseef said, “The main objective of the Center is to do research and train people and give the true, authentic image of the Middle Way of Islam and the Straight Path which it is to eliminate the narrow-mindedness and fundamentalism which is not wise and not in anyone’s interest. But there is nothing new; it is all from the Qur’an and Sunnah and it is all from the life story of the Sahaba (Companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him). We are not claiming that we are introducing new ideas outside of Islam. It really originates from the deep Islamic thought and the Sirah of the Sahaba. This is the renewal. We can bring back the things which have became dormant in our society, to make people aware. This is the work of renewal and awareness.”About the executive body of the Centre Dr. Abdullah Omar Naseef informed that according to the charity commission’s rules and regulations, the Centre has a Board of Trustees composed of four or five Trustees. At present, among the Trustees, there are Sheikh Abdallah Bin Bayyah, Sheikh Salman Al-Oudah, myself and Hamza Yusuf.”“Sheikh Abdallah is the most knowledgeable scholar of today. He highlights the positive side of Islam. We have people of different backgrounds. The idea is to sit together, and to work to project the middle way of thinking and how to renew our way of teaching and make people aware of the real Islam, the great Faith which was instrumental in changing societies of Makkah and Madina and of the whole world,” said Dr. Naseef.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Inability to Offer Prayer in Congregation",
      "Answer": "\nIn our country, where power is held by a secular majority that adopts Western ideologies, we live in a state of severe alienation and restriction. We cannot even answer the call to Prayer. Are we sinners? In fact, if we perform Friday Prayer, we are at a high risk of being imprisoned or punished. What should we do in such circumstances?\nAll praise is to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah. It is too sorrowful a tragedy to find an Islamic country where Muslims are prevented from performing Prayers at mosques. I advise the questioner and other Muslims living in that country to try to talk to the government to allow the performance of congregational Prayers. If it is a fact that the West itself calls for freedom of religion and freedom of thought, then Muslims should never remain in such a restrictive situation. If the questioner could not convince them peacefully, then he should try to move to another country where congregational Prayer is established. And if he could neither move nor negotiate with them, then Allah never lays on one a burden that he cannot bear. When the due time of Prayer commences, he may pray at home in congregation with his family or friends, and he is to perform Friday Prayer as four rak`ahs (units of Prayer) at home too, as long as this is the most he can do. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “If I order you to do something, then do as much as you can of it” [Al-Bukhari, 7288; Muslim 1337].\n\n Original Source Link \n",

And what is the ruling on the property of non-Muslims?\nRegarding the first question, even though he cannot pay back such debts, they remain payables to be fulfilled by him. He must ask Allah for forgiveness, regret his deed, and never do it again.\nAs for the second question, it is impermissible to transgress against property of non-Muslims by cheating, deception, stealth, or whatever. Your entry visa to a certain territory is like a “covenant of security”, which is incompatible with taking others’ property illegally. If you obtain something from a non-Muslim as a free gift or by purchase or some form of transaction, there is no impediment to this. But to appropriate others’ property or swindle them because they are non-Muslims is impermissible in Shari`ah.\n\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Independence Day",
      "Answer": "\nThe Question:\n“Is it allowable to celebrate a holiday that commemorates the independence of my country?”\nThe Answer: \n“A holiday [that commemorates] the independence of a country is not a [religious] holiday. The holidays which are forbidden [for Muslims] to observe are those with religious overtones [such as Christmas and Easter*] not the festive gatherings people observe due to certain events. Therefore, people are allowed to celebrate wedding anniversaries, birthdays or any occasion as such celebrations are not related to religious holidays. It is imperative that we work to remove the confusion surrounding this misunderstanding and the doubts that have affected many people [regarding this issue]. [Because of this misunderstanding] people find hardship and difficulty in their religion. Especially when a religious minded person holds [such non religious celebrations] to be from the major sins or rejected acts when, in fact, they are not.\nUnderstanding an Important legal maxim [The origin of things is permissibility unless there is a text to the contrary]\nThe origin of things is permissibility so there is no problem with you attending such an event. The school of Ahmed [Hanabliah] allowed the celebration of al-’Atirah which was a sacrifice, during the month of Rajab, observed by the people who lived prior to the advent of the Prophet [may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him]. Although the school of Imam Malik [Malikis] considered it disliked, since it was a practice from those days, the school of Ahmed allowed this practice since there was no text [from the Qur’an, Sunna or Consensus] that explicitly forbade it. Thus, this practice remained upon its original ruling, permissibility [here the sheikh is showing us how the scholars utilized the legal maxim mentioned above]. So, if people gather together to sacrifice there is no objection for them to congregate, celebrate, enjoy themselves and commemorate the independence of their country. Therefore, there is no hardship in celebrating such occurrences.\nWith regards to the statement [of the Prophet may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him] that “Allah [The Exalted] has given you better than those (feasts): Eid al-Adha (Sacrificing) and the ‘Eid al-Fitr”, then “those feasts” were those with strict religious over tones: one a Christian holiday and the other a pagan one. In addition, the Prophet [may the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him] mentioned that the Islamic holidays were two: ‘Eid al-Fitr and ‘Eid al-Adha. But it is not understood from this that he [may the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him] forbade people from gathering and celebrating [other non-religious occasions]. Even if a person considered [such gatherings] disliked there is no need for him to bother others by making things difficult that were not prohibited by the Qur’an, the Sunna, the consensus [of the scholars] and where no agreement was reached within the schools of Islamic law.\nThis is because ease in matters [such as these where there is no prohibition and the origin is that of permissibility] is a must, and those statements that create hardship and burden [related to such matters], that are not based on explicit texts [that prohibit them], are weak. Thus, there is nothing that prohibits us from facilitating such matters for the people and giving them some breathing room because ease and facilitation are from the foundations of Islam: Allah says, “And He did not make any hardship for you in religion.” [Surah al-Hajj 78] and “Allah wants to lighten your burdens.” [Surah al-Nisa V. 28] and “Verily, with hardship there is ease. Verily with hardship there is ease.” [Surah al-Sharh V. 5-6]. The Prophet [may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him] said, “Facilitate [things] and do not make things difficult. Give glad tidings, and do not cause others to flee.” In closing, we reiterate that the foundation of Islam is ease and the independent interpretation of the legal sources [ijtihad of scholars] is respected but is not [equal to] texts from the Shari’ah [Qur’an and Sunna].”\nMay peace be upon you Dr. Abdullah Bin Bayyah\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "In Search of What We Share with Others",
      "Answer": "\nThe judicious often complain of the confrontational approach between civilizations on the subject of communication. They complain about the ‘burning of bridges’, but what can be done to put an end to this confrontation? Arguably, one of the main solutions is to focus on the common ground between civilizations.\nThis first step towards commonality was part of the subject of our previous lectures on the problem of communication (or miscommunication) between Islamic and other civilizations. Here, we say that cultural contact is needed to highlight what is shared between two parties, which might otherwise be hidden or unclear for them. It may be that giving the two parties the chance to inform each other of their common ground facilitates the process of communication itself and enables them to discuss the points on which they differ as well. The shared points that parties can focus on can be employed in two main areas: human values and religious values.\nHuman Values\nAll people look for peace and justice and equally hate injustice and tyranny. What one does not accept for oneself he should not accept for others. This is the human conscience, which we must revive through highlighting the values in which all believe.\nThere are certain criteria upon which people do not differ. Such criteria are built on logic and reason, which Descartes describes as “the best thing distributed among people.” They are also built on the principles of human nature, made by Allah with which He has made men. It is the issue known in Islamic philosophy as the issue of judging matters to be either good or bad. Al-Qadi Abdul-Jabbar al-Mu`tazili stated that: “Judging matters to be either good or bad is one of essential knowledge created by Allah in humans.” Ibn Taymiyyah and his student Ibn Al-Qayyim opined that acts are either good or bad by nature, and the mind recognizes this goodness in some of them and badness in others.\nIn his book Madarij Al-Salikin, Ibn al-Qayyim says: “Allah’s Saying, “…who enjoins upon them what is right and forbids them what is wrong,” (Al-A`raf 7:157) confirms that the religion with which Allah sent the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) orders what is judged by sound reasons to be good, and forbids what is judged by them to be bad.” Among those who considered judging matters to be either good or bad depending on reason were:\n1)      the followers of Imam Abu Hanifah, and even this opinion is attributed to imam Abu Hanifah himself;\n2)      Abu al-Khattab al-Kluzani and Abu al-Hasan al-Tamimi, who are two great Hanbali scholars; and\n3)      the great Shafi`i scholars Abu Ali ibn Abu Hurayrah and Abu Bakr al-Qaffal al-Shashi al-Kabir.\nThe Imam of Al-Haramayn Al-Sharifayn (“the Two Sacred Mosques: the Sacred Mosque in Mecca and the Prophet’s Mosque in Madinah”) accepted this concept in regards to human actions, but held that it does not apply to Allah’s Actions. This view supports Al-Ghazali’s theories. It can be said that Muslims create a link between good and goodness to a large extent. In short, those who depend on reason for judging what is good and what is bad make reason the criterion of values, which is common to all humanity. That is, justice is good, and unfairness is bad to the end. Descartes states: “Verily, reason is the best thing equally distributed among all human beings. The international document of human rights represents the most important attempt to employ the shared points between humanity.”\nReligious values\nIn Islam, such values are determined by the Messengers of Allah. In the Qur’an, Allah says: “Say (O Muhammad): “O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a word that is just between us and you”…” (Al-Imran 3:64) And: “…say (to them): “We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you; our Ilah (God) and your Ilah (God) is One (i.e. Allah), and to Him we have submitted (as Muslims)”.” (Al-Ankabut 29:46)\nHunter Mead describes western civilization as inherently Christian: “When we, philosophers, say “Christian”, we mean a “monotheist”. Believing in one God Who governs the universe which He created is the basis of religious thinking of the West. These commands, i.e. all the commands of God, apply to all people everywhere.” This belief is common, as pointed out by some fair-minded Christian clergies, such as Hans-Kyung when he said: “For Jews, Christians and Muslims, faith means that with all their strength and thought human beings here are unconditionally committed to submit and trust in God and His Words.”\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Immigration to a Non-Muslim Country",
      "Answer": "\nPeace be upon you. Can you please explain the wisdom behind the fact that Allah created the heavens and earth in six days? We are asked this question repeatedly by Hindus working here in the Kingdom. They say: If your lord can create everything just by saying “Be” and it is, why did he create them in six days? Please give us a convincing answer. Glorified be Allah above all that they associate as partners with Him. May Allah reward you with good and benefit the Muslims from your knowledge!\nFirstly: Allah says: “He cannot be questioned as to what He does, while they will be questioned.” To those who do not know the Creator I say: He cannot be asked about anything He does while the created ones can be asked. Everything the Creator does or says has a reason. He teaches His creations by means of His Actions. He teaches them the importance of gradation and that creations evolve and develop. Just like a small boy grows up slowly until he is mature, the universe is created gradually. This is one of the wisdoms. Another is that time and place are closely connected in the journey of existence. Allah decreed that these six days and the seventh one are the bases of all calculations. The connection between time and place is very strong. This is how everything went according to a set plan until the world became ready for us, with its heavens and earth. Time is not a tangible factor while place is a tangible one and that is why Allah connected them both. Such matters cannot be understood except by people who are heedful and who submit their will to Allah. Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah be merciful to him) said, “Tell those with blurry eyes that sunrise and sunset are seen by other eyes. Some people are content with appearances and do not even look for the essence.” Ask those people about the wisdom behind creating days or time. This is only known to the Creator and man is weaker and more trivial to ask the Creator and question Him. “He cannot be questioned as to what He does, while they will be questioned.” (Al-Anbiya’, 21:23) Everything Allah does has a reason and if man does not see it, this is because of his inability to see. That is what I have to say in this regard and Allah knows best.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Illusions &#038; Misconceptions about Islam",
      "Answer": "\nIn the previous article, we discussed some illusions among Westerners about the personality of our noble Messenger and about the teachings and perceptions of our great religion. In this article, we continue to discuss and refute misconceptions about and accusations laid against Islam.\nI. Embracing Islam under Compulsion\nIt is relevant to highlight the fact that embracing Islam under compulsion is unacceptable. Islamic Shari`ah is all based on free choice, and when free choice is lacking, one’s conducts shall have no effect, whether in beliefs, contracts, commitments, etc. This is substantiated in numerous texts in the Glorious Qur’an and Prophetic hadiths.\nAllah says, {There shall be no compulsion in religion}. This is a self-evident verse from Surah Al-Baqarah, which was sent down in Media, where Muslims were gaining more and more power — contrary to the Pope’s claim that it was sent down when Muslims were weak. It is a regretful, ill-founded claim. The truth is, a number of youths from Al-Ansar (Medinan supporters of the Prophet) were raised among Jews, and their families wanted to force them to embrace their religion. Then, Allah forbade them, asserting the rule of noncompulsion.\nAlso, in Surah Yunus, Allah says, {Had your Lord so willed, all who are on the earth would have believed altogether. Will you, then, (be the one to) compel people so that they become believers?} He also says, in Surah Al-Kahf, {And say, “The truth is from your Lord. So, whoever wills let him believe. And whoever wills let him disbelieve}. And in Surah Al-Ghashiyah, Allah says, {So, remind (people). You are but a reminder. You are not over them domineering}.\nSimilarly, when someone renounces Islam due to coercion, this renunciation shall have no effect. Allah says, {Except for one who has been compelled (to renounce his faith) while his heart remains at peace with faith} [Surah An-Nahl].\nIn Islamic jurisprudence, coercion is an unreasonable influence that renders contracts and commitments made thereunder null and void. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) was reported to have said, “Allah has pardoned my Ummah for mistakes, forgetfulness, and that which they are forced to do”.\nII. Concept of Jihad\nJihad is a beautiful concept that has been misused, whether by extremist adherence or by utter negligence.\nWhat does jihad mean linguistically and technically? And why is it legislated in the Qur’an?\nIn Arabic usage, jihad is the “exertion of the utmost effort to achieve something that is probably desirable”.\nReligiously, jihad has three types, as identified by Ar-Raghib in Al-Mufradat (The Items): (1) jihad against an express enemy, (2) jihad against Satan, and (3) jihad against one’s own self.\nThe last two meanings are stated in several hadiths. For example, Imam Ahmad in his Musnadand Abu Dawud in his Sunan reported Fudalah Ibn `Ubayd as narrating that the Prophet said,“A true mujahid is the one who strives against his own self in obedience to Allah, the Almighty”.\nIn a weak hadith reported by Al-Bayhaqi, Jabir narrated that, upon return from his last conquest Tabuk, the Prophet said, “We have returned from the minor jihad to the major jihad”. He interpreted it as meaning to combat one’s whims.\nIn fact, taking care of one’s parents is a sort of jihad. The Prophet said, “Then let your taking care of them be your jihad”.\nIbn Taymiyyah defined jihad saying, “It encompasses all sorts of worship, whether inward or outward, including love of Allah, devotion to Him, reliance on Him, submission of one’s soul and property to Him, patience, asceticism, and continuing remembrance of Him. It takes all possible forms — physical, spiritual, mental, verbal, etc.”\nThe first meaning, jihad or fighting against hostile non-Muslims, is the most common. Many Qur’anic verses and Prophetic hadiths detailed its merits, conditions, and guidelines. History reveals significant instances and practices of it between Muslims and non-Muslims, which have ever been an object of large-scale attention and heated debate, wavering between glorification and condemnation, overenthusiasm and neglect. How many people justify aggression and colonialism on the pretext of jihad or holy war! And how many people desert jihad and shrink from resisting the enemies, leading to catastrophic consequences! And how many movements and groups do not comply with the limits and rules of jihad, to the detriment of the image of Islam and Muslims! And how many anti-Islam opponents who contend that Islamic jihad is unjustifiable and is motivated by a blind desire to fight against non-Muslims, as Murad Hofmann quotes Father Hans Kung as saying. This is just one of many false accusations contained in orientalist writings to justify aggressive wars against Muslims, on the grounds of making Muslims civilized and peaceful.\nJihad in Islam is not necessarily synonymous to fighting; it has a much broader sense. Basically, it means to preach and defend what is right. In Surah Al-Furqan, Allah says, {And strive against them (i.e., advocates of falsehood) by means of it (i.e., the Qur’an), with the utmost strife}. That is, refute false claims with every possible evidence. Obviously, recitation of the Qur’an has nothing to do with military actions. Therefore, not every jihad should be fighting, and not every fighting should be jihad. In its essence, jihad is a call for freedom.\nNot every jihad is a military action, nor is every military action jihad. Ibn Khaldun divided warfare into four types, depending on the motive. He wrote, “The origin of all wars is revengefulness. Two wars are unjust: war of expansion and war of aggression. And two wars are just: war in defence of religion (jihad) and war against rebels (sovereignty protection war, as he called it).\nIn the next article, we will discuss illusions and fallacies about the concept of and ruling on jihad in Islam.\n\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Ideal Approach Towards Issues of Creed (Where is Allah)",
      "Answer": "\nThe Question:\n“Is it allowable for one to ask where Allah is? Is Allah (May He be exalted) above His servants? And is that understanding representative of anthropomorphism? Also, what is our position towards those who say that such a question is not permissible and that Allah (swt) is above any place or location?”\nThe Answer:\nAffirming Allah’s Exalted Status:\n“Indeed, Allah (swt) describes Himself as being The Most High: “Praise the name of your Lord The Most High.” And, “He is The High.” and, “He is the High the All Powerful.” (Based on these verses) it is not allowed for anyone to dispute (the truth) of this attribute, nor is it allowable for any Muslim to differ regarding it. As for inquiring about the nature (of this attribute), then this is not something that you are obliged to deal with, nor is it something sought from you. There is the hadith of the slave woman who was brought to the Prophet (Peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) with her master so she could be freed and the Prophet (Peace and blessing be upon him) asked her, “Where is Allah?” However, this hadith is ahad and there is no other narration of the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) where he (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asks someone this question. Nor is it related that any of our pious ancestors asked such a question.\nInteracting with such texts:\nIt is important to note that questions like this are not sought after nor desired from you. However, when approached with such issues you should do the following:\nFirst, you should read the verse that affirms Allah’s highness. Second, you should read the verse that negates anything being like Him. Finally, you should avoid delving into the deeper meaning of the verse (meaning the how related to Allah’s attribute but just simply affirm it and negate its likeness to creation or vice versa). This is important (to not delve into this/nor make it a bigger issue than it is) because it is not a matter related to actions, and on the Day of Reckoning Allah (May He be exalted) is going to ask you about your actions not His essence. And this (methodology) is the way of the first 3 generations of saints and scholars of the Muslim nation of which there is no uncertainty. Imam Al-Tufi (May Allah have mercy upon him) said: “The way of Imam Ahmed (may Allah have mercy upon him) and the rest of the scholars of the early generations was to affirm these attributes without commenting on them.” Therefore, when it came to these attributes, they would (affirm them) and say nothing. And this was the way of Abu Nua’yim (may Allah have mercy upon him) the teacher of Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy upon him). Ibn Kathir (May Allah lighten his grave), in his explanation of the verse, “Then He rose upon the thrown” states: “We allow this verse to pass as it is while eliminating any anthropomorphic/thepomorphic elements from Allah’s existence. Exalted is He from what the intellect suggests.” And these where the words of Abu Nua’yim, the teacher of the teacher of Al-Bukhari, the teacher of Imam Ahmed and Yahya ibn Ma’in(May Allah have mercy upon all of them). Thus, differing about this issue and arguing about time and place (with respect to the Divine) is not something from the actions of the early generations and is in contrast to what they were upon. Therefore (when encountering verses like this), you should say nothing and read the verse as it is. Hence, what is necessary is for you to believe as the early generations believed without adding or deducting (anything). And this is what is required of you so do not dispute (with others) about it.”\nAnd Allah knows best.\nSh. Abdullah bin Bayyah (May Allah preserve him)\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Human Rights in Islam",
      "Answer": "\nIn the Quran, there are various clear and strong texts that have delineated the fundamentals of human rights. However, the first declaration that can be called so is the magnificent speech delivered by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) in the Farewell Pilgrimage before about 120 thousands of his companions who gathered in `Arafat. In this speech, he laid the foundations of what can be called human rights. He declared the inviolability of bloods, properties, and honors and asked Allah and the people to bear witness to that. In this context, he has strongly forbidden inner fighting saying “Never shall you return after me [like] disbelievers striking the necks of one another.” He also recommended well treatment for women.\nThe essence of human rights can be summarized in two principles:\n– Honoring, which is an established maxim for every human being just for being a human being. Almighty Allah said, “Yet very truly, We have so honored the Children of Adam: for We have carried them through the land and the sea. And We have provided them with all that is wholesome [in life]. And We have so favored them above most of what We have created with [such immense] favor.” [17:70]\n– Equality, upon which Islam laid strong emphasis, as the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “O people! Your Lord is one and your father is one. Neither an Arab has a merit over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab over an Arab nor a white person over a black one. You all belong to Adam and Adam was from dust.”\nFrom these two principles begin all rights. Women have been given equal rights to those of men in terms of human honor- though this may vary for other functional reasons- and in terms of all forms of freedom. Man is originally free. This was best expressed in the words of `Umar, the Commander of the Believer “When have you enslaved people whereas they were born free?!”\nEuropeans had to wait for 1000 years later until Jan Jack Rousseau declared in his book The Social Contract that man is born free. But freedom of the individual in Islam should not bring harm to the society. Equilibrium between the individual and the society is the most critical issue in the principle of freedom. Freedom is guaranteed as long as it does not contravene the general system as in the cases of reviling the religion, cursing people, or making transgressions against their bloods or properties. However, there may be difference of opinion over determining the general system and its ethical dimensions as will be explained.\nIslam is the religion of solidarity in the sense that it not only enjoins you to refrain from harming others but also enjoins you, as a religious and juridical duty, to prevent people from causing harm to each others and to do your best to aid people, save their lives, protect their properties, and defend their honor. If you do not do so, you will become sinful; and a case can be filed against you in courts demanding compensation from you because you did not save a person from fire, prevent a blind person from falling in an abyss, etc. This is called the right of aid and support. “Then what is with you that you do not fight in the path of Allah and for the [utterly] helpless.” [4:75]\nIn short, all fundamental human rights are found in Islam. Man is honored by Allah and has the right to be respected and not to infringe his privacy. “Nor shall you spy [on each other]. Nor shall you backbite one another.” [49:12] “O you who believe! You shall not enter houses, other than your own houses, until you take [welcome] permission and great their people with peace.” [24:27]\nHowever, this is not confined to Muslims but extends to peoples from other religions as well. Al-Bayhaqy in his Sunan reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) forbad from entering the houses of the People of the Scripture without their permission and from eating their fruits unless they give it out of themselves.\nIslam secured for man that he should not be addressed in a way he dislikes. Almighty Allah said, “O you who believe! Men shall not scoff at other men. For those [whom they scoff at] may be better than them. Nor shall women [scoff] at other women. For those [whom they scoff at] may be better than them. Nor shall you slander each other. Nor shall you revile each other by [way of abhorrent] nicknames.” [49:11]; and that he shall not be punished for someone else’s crime “For no sin-laden soul shall carry the [sinful] load of another.” [17:15] Man is innocent until the opposite proves true and should not be punished retroactively.\nIslam guaranteed for man the right of ownership and to make use of the things that are not possessed by anybody such as earth, seas, rivers, wild animal, and fish.\nPeople are partners in water, fire, grass. It is not permissible to transgress the possessions of others. If one dies and leaves something, it goes to his heir. People share natural resources with justice and kindness. Selling, leasing, loaning, borrowing, trading, and giving gifts are lawful means of earning to the exclusion of unlawful means such as theft, usurpation, usury, deception and gambling.\nThe poor and the weak have rights in the society and thus it is not permissible to leave any of them exposed to danger. These rights guaranteed by both the shari`ah and the judicial authority.\nIslam has also guaranteed for the traveler that the resident people should guide him, give him to eat, and give him out of the zakah-charity if he needs because he is a wayfarer.\nIt has guaranteed the parents’ right and has enjoined children- by the judiciary power- to spend on them if they are poor; and so is the case with close relatives.\nThese rights are many and hence they have made the Muslim community cohesive, harmonious, and consolidated. Islam has enjoined those in authority among Muslims to establish the fundamental human rights and has given them in return for this duty the right of obeying them. Almighty Allah says, “O you who believe! You shall obey Allah. And you shall obey the Messenger and those in authority among you.” [4:59]\nScholars have founded what they called the objectives of the shari`ah; that is, the meanings derived from the totality of shari`ah texts identifying the goals of the shari`ah and its targets in isolation from the texts. Abu Ishaq al-Shatiby delineated the injunctions of the shari`ah saying: They refer to the preservation of its objectives with regard to the people. These objectives do not exceed three divisions: first, to be necessary, second to be complementary, and third to be embellishing.\nThose that are necessary are indispensable for the interests of the religion and of this world which, if missed, this world will not go right but will go with corruption, turbulence, loss of life, loss of deliverance and bliss and with ultimate clear loss.\nThese objectives include the preservation of all fundamental and economic human rights, but they exceed with other indispensable rights for man’s promotion and protection, which are the goals of human rights. The necessary objective can be interpreted to be the right to live, the right of ownership, and the right to from a family in addition to the right of preserving reason, the right of practicing religion, and the right to preserve posterity.\nAl-Shatiby pointed this out saying: The ummah (Muslim nation), rather all religions, has agreed that the shari`ah aims to preserve the five essentials: religion, souls, posterity, property, and reason.\nAl-Ghazali said:  Man’s feeling safe for himself, property, and honor is a condition for the obligation of acts of worship.\nThe complementary objective can be translated as man’s right to have education, house, and other rights that lift the hardship of life and secure honorable living. Almighty Allah says, “Nor has He placed on you any [undue] strain.” [22:78]\nThe embellishing objective aims at giving life beauty and fun and enjoying wholesome things, as Almighty Allah says, “Say: Who is it that has prohibited the adornments of Allah, which He has brought forth for His servants, and the wholesome things of [His] provision?” [7:32]\nThese objectives set the foundation of an integrated and balanced outlook for human rights accompanied with the duty of both the society and the individual to secure and protect them as a religious responsibility as well as a legal and juridical one; that is, they are not just admonitory but biding- this is the advantage of law.\nSome of us may see that this definition is close to the concept of the natural state or the natural law from which human rights derive their legitimacy and comprehensiveness as seen by some philosophers.\nWe can summarize the basic principles of human rights in Islam in the following points:\n1. Establishing the state on the idea of shura (consultation) starting with the choice the ruler and paying homage to him to continue ruling under the obligation of abiding by shari`ah rulings.\n2. Enforcing the principle of legitimacy through the state executive authority and the judicial authority to protect the rights from all sorts of aggression or transgression and hence to prevent assault, taking captives and revenge.\n3. Declaring the principle of equality between people, abolishing the system of classes and the habit of boasting with lineage and families, and establishing honor on the basis of piety alone; that is, on the basis of true faith accompanied by righteous work.\n4. Establishing general freedoms on top of which come the sacredness of souls, honor, and properties along with housing, freedom of religion and opinion, freedom of work, and freedom of education as an obligatory right. It is a duty upon the society and the individuals to cooperate to preserve these rights.\n5. Freedom of ownership accompanied by the obligation of social justice achieved through the imposition of zakah-charity and other duties on the properties of the rich for the sake of the underprivileged and the needy through the system of maintenance.\n6. Freedom of making contracts and the obligation of fulfilling them and the freedom of trading and transacting accompanied by the restriction of preventing usury, ghabn (unfair pricing), monopolization, gharar (hazardous sale of uncertainty), and coercion and the exclusion of wills and the obligations of inheritance.\n7. Fair treatment of women by giving them the right of inheritance, ownership, and discretion together with the basics of honor and equality in rights and duties and establishing marriage on cordiality and mercy. The wife has been given the right of dowry as a sort of honor for her and as discouraging from divorce without excuse. Polygamy was restricted with the condition of just treatment. Marriage of shighar (exchange of daughters or sisters for marriage with no mandatory gift to a bride from her groom), temporary mirage, and burying female babies alive are practices that have been prohibited.\n8. Regulating penalties and distinguishing between the public right or the right of Almighty Allah and the personal right and distinguishing between legal penalties prescribed by the shari`ah and other penalties that are not prescribed but left for the discretion of the judge known as ta`zeer in addition to regulating the conditions of the crime of murdering and deliberate injuries and determining blood money and compensations.\n9. Setting the foundation of international law of relations exhorting peace and brotherhood and the obligation of fulfilling covenants disallowing aggressive war and allowing defensive war for the sake of repelling aggression against religion, home, and holy places, preserving the freedom of religion, and helping the wronged person even if he is non Muslim.\n10. Freedom of expression known as enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. This freedom is bound by the dictates of responsibility, for Islam considers the consequences of deeds and words. Thus, there is no freedom of speech to curse others or to disseminate harmful values in the society- it is responsible freedom.\n11. The right of the poor and the weak in economic protection. Almighty Allah says, “Thus they feed with food- despite their own desire for it- the indigent, and the orphan, and the captive [of war]” [76:8] and “Moreover, in their wealth was a rightful share [of charity] for the beggar and the destitute.” [51:19]\n12. The right of people in fairness and justice. Almighty Allah says, “O you who believe! Be ever upright for [the sake of] Allah, bearing witness [to truth] with [impartial] justice. Therefore, let not detestation [for some people] induce you to be unfair. [Rather,] be fair! For to do so is, indeed, closer to the fear of Allah. Therefore, fear Allah! Indeed, Allah is all-aware of all that you do” and [5:8] “And whenever you judge between people, you shall judge with justice.” [4:58]\n13. The right of people on each other to cooperate and have mutual assistance. Almighty Allah says, “Rather, you shall help one another to virtuousness and to the fear of Allah. But you shall not help one another to sin and to aggression.” [5:2] Others’ right of justice was not known before Islam. Islam was the first to acknowledge these rights regardless of sex, race, ethnicity, or religion.\nThe Gracious Quran speaks about just cooperation that is based on the principle of freedom and the supremacy of the society “Say: O People of the Scripture! Come to an equitable word between us and you: That we shall not worship other than Allah. And we shall not associate anything in [our worship of] Him. And we shall not take one another as lords apart from Allah.”[3:64] explaining this verse Muhammad ibn `Amr al-Razy (544-606/1149-1209) said, “‘An equitable word’ indicates justice and fairness between all of us in terms of worshipping Allah equitably.” This means that there should be no extravagance or hegemony of one group over the other. All people enjoy freedom and equality before Allah, the One and Only God of all the people.\n14.  The right to refuse prohibited things; that is, the right not to be forced to commit things prohibited by the shari`ah. The noble Messenger said, “No created being should be obeyed in disobedience of the Creator.” Almighty Allah said, “He said: The promise of My covenant shall not extend to the wrongdoers.” [2:124] By virtue of this, no ruler can enact the lawfulness of something prohibited or detrimental to people’s interests. The juristic rule is that “the ruler’s management of the subjects is bound by serving their interest.” Similarly, it is not for a powerful state or nation, even if it is a Muslim one, to impose things that cause harm to the interests of small countries.\n15. Protecting properties. Almighty Allah says, “Moreover, you shall not consume one another’s wealth by false means, nor proffer any of it to [bribe] those in authority, in order to sinfully consume a portion of people’s wealth- while you know [it is wrong].” [2:188]\n16. Preserving human dignity and honor. Almighty Allah says, “O you who believe! Men shall not scoff at other men. For those [whom they scoff at] may be better than them. Nor shall women [scoff] at other women. For those [whom they scoff at] may be better than them. Nor shall you slander each other. Nor shall you revile each other by [way of abhorrent] nicknames. Woeful is the ungodly name after attaining faith” [49:11] and “O you who believe! Shun much suspicion. For, indeed, certain kinds of suspicion are sinful. Nor shall you spy [on each other]. Nor shall you backbite one another.” [49:12]\n17. Protecting private life. Almighty Allah says, “O you who believe! You shall not enter homes, other than your own homes, until you take [welcome] permission and greet their people with peace. That is best for you- so that you may become mindful [of the benefit of Allah’s commandments]. But if you do not find anyone therein, then do not enter them until permission is given to you. Moreover, if it is said to you: Turn back! then turn back [and do not persist]. That is purer for you.” [24:27-28]\nHuman rights in Islam enjoy the privilege that the wise Lawgiver gave them a divine source, a sacred essence, and a rational characteristic. They are established by the Creator’s will and derived from His religion. They are beyond whims and are secured forever.\nDr. Khayyat maintains that human rights fall within the divine appointment of man as a successor. The covenant of succession includes his rights and duties and there is harmony and synchronization between individual’s rights and public interest. Each right for the individual includes a right for God- i.e., for the society- though priority is given to God’s right in the case of conflict. These rights includes the five necessities of the shari`ah; namely, the preservation of religion, reason, soul, posterity, and property.\nPerhaps the most important mainstay for human rights in the shari`ah is the independence of the judiciary; for the judge’s only reference is to the shari`ah and his conscience.\nThis independence is shown by the brief message sent by `Umar, the commander of the believers, (may Allah be pleased with him) to Mu`awiyah ibn Abu Sufyan, the governor of Syria and Palestine telling him that “You have no authority over `Ubadah ibn al-Samit.” `Ubadah was sent by the Caliph as a judge for Palestine. `Umar, thus, put an end for the governors’ interference in judiciary.\nHere is another message sent by the Caliph `Umar ibn al-Khattab to Abu Mosa al-Ash`ary establishing the rules of judiciary that secure rights:\n“Judgeship is a firm obligation and a followed methodology. So you should comprehend what is submitted before you; for it is useless to speak with a truth that is not enforceable. Treat people equally in terms of how approach you, how you face them, and how you judge between them so that no noble person should wish for your unjust inclination and no weak person should despair of your justice. Evidence is upon the claimant and vow is on the one who denies. Reconciliation between Muslims is permissible except that reconciliation that renders the unlawful lawful and the lawful unlawful. Whoever claims an absent right or evidence give him respite with fixed date, for this way you give the best excuse and clarify the blindness of the issue. No sentence you passed one day and then you revised it and was guided to the right opinion should prevent you from returning to the truth. The truth is old and nothing renders it void. Returning to the truth is better than going forward with falsehood. Muslims are trustworthy with one another with the exception of someone known for false testimony or someone whipped in penalty for a crime or a person whose credibility is under suspicion due to his alliance or relation to another. Almighty Allah is aware of the secrets of people and He has concealed the reasons of their falling under penalty unless with clear evidences and oaths. You should thoroughly comprehend that which is submitted before you and is not in the Quran or the Sunnah and then apply analogy.\nBe aware of similar cases and look for what you see as the best in the sight of Allah and closer to the truth. Beware of anger, anxiety, boredom, feeling hurt by people and seeking to be remembered by the disputants. Judging in favor of the truth is a reason for deserving the reward of Allah and for having good remembrance among people. Hence, he who is sincere to the truth, even against himself, Allah will sufficiently take care of what is between him and the people. He who adorns himself with that which is not within himself will be disgraced by Allah. Allah does not accept from a person except that which is sincerely for Him. What do you think of the reward of Allah in His near provision and the treasures of His mercy?! Peace be upon you together with the mercy of Allah.”\nIbn al-Qayyem al-Jawziyyah said, “This message is great and scholars received it with approval and established upon it the rules of judgeship and testimony. The ruler and the mufti (jurist counselor) are more needful to reflect on and learn it.”\nDuring the Abbasid period and in the end of the second century of Hijrah the caliph kept himself away from appointing judges as he entrusted this judiciary. Al-Rasheed appointed Abu Yousof as a judge and entrusted him to appoint judges in other countries and thus judiciary had some sort of administrative independence.\nOffice of the ombudsman can be considered an advanced means to protect human rights; particularly from the injustice of the authorities. It was established by al-Mahdy in the second half of the second century of Hijrah. It received people’s complaints even against high officials. Al-Mady and his successors up to the period of al-Muhatady (255 AH) used to dedicate one or two days a week to sit and listen to people’s complaints against those in authority as well as others.\nMilitary justice was formed during the Mamluki period after expelling the crusaders from Syria by the end of the seventh century. This judiciary was for settling disputes among the soldiers. In Damascus there were two military judges.\nAfter this quick survey over human rights in Islam, we shall focus on four key issues due to their importance in the current dialogue over human rights in Islam to see in the light of the shari`h and under the shade of the Western philosophy the prejudice against the Islamic shari`ah. We are going to dedicate four chapters for these issues: the first chapter will be about the status of women, the second about freedom and equality, the third about shura(consultation) and democracy, and the forth about Islamic criminal laws and human rights.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Human Rights between Islam and the West",
      "Answer": "\nWith regard to human rights in the West as a universal principle, we are going to introduce their background and philosophy from a Western perspective through a Western writer. I will interfere with only some short and limited comments to draw attention to some useful points in comparison. This writer is called Asberon Eide, director and founder of the Norwegian Institute of Human Rights at Oslo University. He says about the initiative and crystallization of the declaration:\nThe first initiative to make human rights a universal principle was by the then American president Franklin Delano Roosevelt in his letter to the American Congress in January 1941. His initiative was amazing due to the comprehensive aspect he gave to human freedoms and due to his insistence on that these freedoms have to be enjoyed with all over the world. He said, “In the coming days, which we work to make safe, we are looking forward to a world founded on four human freedoms: first, freedom of speech everywhere; second, freedom of everyone  to worship God in his own way, anywhere in the world; third, freedom “to want”, which means– if translated into universal concepts- understanding and economic intelligence that secures for each country  a healthy and peaceful life for its population and everywhere in the world; fourth, freedom from fear which means- if translated into universal concepts- to reduce arms across the world to the degree and extent that no country will be able to commit transgression against any neighboring country anywhere in the world.”\nHe also said, “This is not a vision for thousand years away, it is a defined basis for a world that we can achieve for ourselves in our age and our generation.”\nThen there was the Atlantic Declaration in August 1941 by President Roosevelt and the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill who reiterated the same commitments after few months. In the 1st of January 1942 representatives of the governments of many countries in the East and the West met in Washington to approve the UN Declaration. As the Allays in the Word War II, their goal was to decide the goals they were fighting for. The governments represented in the meeting declared that the goal of gaining victory over their enemy was to defend life, freedom, independence, and religious freedom as well as to preserve human rights and justice in their lands and in others’ lands.\nIn 1942 an international group of researchers and diplomats convened at an invitation from the American Institute of Law, which is a private institution in the United States specialized in collecting and making laws, to develop a formula for a possible declaration or a memorandum for international human rights. The cultures represented in this group were the American, the Arabic, the British, the Canadian, the Chinese, the French, the Nazi German, the Italian, the Latin American, the Polish, the Russian, and the Spanish. The group finished the program of the human rights memorandum in 1944, but it did nothing more at that time. This memorandum was the basic inspiration when the UN Human Rights Department headed by the Canadian John Humphrey prepared the first project of the International Declaration in 1947. Many other initiatives followed until the end of the World War II. One was presented by a Latin American country as a follow-up to an international conference held in Mitchaboltpk in Mexico early in 1945 between the two Americans over the problems of war and peace.\nWhen the founding conference was held in San Francisco in 1945, many of the Latin American countries exercised pressure so that the Charter of the UN itself should include a memorandum on human rights. Of these memorandums was the one prepared by the group assembled by the American Institute of Law and presented by the representative of Panama.\nIt was decided then that the charter should include a statement concerning establishing a human rights committee and that this committee should undertake the task of developing a draft for the international standards in the field of human rights.\nArticle (55 )H from the charter states that the UN will enhance and monitor the international respect for human rights as well as the fundamental freedoms for all without distinction or discrimination on racial, sexual, linguistic or religious basis. In article (56) all the member countries pledged to exert joint or individual efforts to cooperate with the UN as determined in article (55).\nThe charter of the UN is an international treaty by which all UN member countries have by law to support respecting and implementing human rights and fundamental freedoms without any distinction or discrimination.\nThe human rights committee started its job in 1947 and the drafting committee represented different parts of the world. It consisted of delegations from Australia, China, France, Lebanon, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. The first draft prepared by John Humphrey, director of Human Rights in the UN, was largely based on the work that had been continuing since 1942 which was accomplished by representatives from different cultures. The final formula was based on an adapted draft edited by the French Rene Kayan. It was presented in the summer of 1948 to the General Assembly of the UN which approved it with light modifications in the 10th of December 1948. The Declaration includes a wide range of human rights such as the rights related to one’s safety (right to live – freedom from torture and maltreatment- freedom from slavery and from arbitrary deprivation of freedom), the rights related to necessary procedures and just trials, freedom to work and to express and practice any creed, freedom of speech and media, freedom of movement and the freedom of forming associations (such as workers’ unions and syndicates) as well as political, economical, social and cultural rights. This is the widest range of human rights approved until now by any agreement, be it national or international. (Eide, Asberon: The Historical Significance of the International Declaration; al-Majallah al-Dawlyyah li al-`Ulum al-Ijtima`iyyah pp 19-21, issue 158, December 1998)\nComment: This was an interesting presentation by Asberon for such wonderful principles. But it cannot be hidden that the international rights crystallized in Roosevelt’s initiative in his letter to the Congress represented an American, and similarly European, concern regarding the conflict with the communist bloc which started to emerge on the eve of the defeat of the German Reich. It talked about reducing arms, which indicates that it is an initiative affected by the results and atmosphere of the war. Not only this, but it also attempted to ensure for the Allies a position that gives them the upper hand over the international affairs on ethical basis. With regard to the representatives of the cultures he talked about, it will be suitable to pose a question about the representation of the Islamic culture or rather the complete exclusion of the Islamic culture from these discussions, though there were independent Islamic countries such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia. We do not intend to cast doubt on the role of Lebanon which represented the Middle East through its representative Mr. Sharl Malik who was an experienced legist and a distinguished personality but his share of the Islamic culture was not as big as his awareness of the Western culture, to say the least. In Addition, though he was a prominent personality, he was not representative of a power that could be listened to in a discussion held by the victorious countries in the World War.\nIt is a declaration that is imposed retroactively on cultures that were absent such as the Islamic and Chinese cultures. We are going to talk about this later.\nAccording to Subhy al-Mahmasany, the development of human rights in the West started with the Romans. The Roman law developed over 14 centuries; that is, since the establishment of Rome in the 8th century BC up to the death of Emperor Justinatius in the 6th century AD. Over this long history, the sources of legislation were many. Beside custom and tradition, there were laws issued by the state, the discretion of judges, and legists’ studies. The laws over the Roman period were issued by the king, the congress, different parliaments, or the Emperor.\nMeanwhile, the discretions of judges played great role in the development of the Roman legislation; particularly, through the decrees of Alberito, judge of the judge, who contributed to promote the procedures and to inlay old civil law with some people’s rulings and hence to approve equality in rights between the classes of the population of the Empire.\nContribution was also made by Roman legists through their researches, explanations, and books; particularly, the famous five: Babinjnos of Homs, Olpejanos of Sur, Gaius, Paul, and Moudstinos.\nJustinatius gave orders that these various sources should be recorded in six books. Thus they were collected with the title of “A Compilation of Civil Rights”. Most of the Modern European laws have been affected by the Roman legislation and adopted it as their basis.\nSporri Eide, however, holds the view that the most important stage in the development of human rights is such slow development that Europe witnessed in the form of intellectual conflict between different liberal and conservative ideas over four centuries. Moreover, the idea of human rights itself when used by the developers of the memorandums of 1947- 1948 expressed the concept of the modern age. They were preceded by older and narrower terms such as “natural rights”, “man’s rights” and “civil rights.”\nWe can trace the roots of the change that took place in world thought during the age of Renaissance which inaugurated rational discussions that growingly liberated themselves from the vagueness and ambiguity of the past centuries to bear glad tidings of an explosion in the scientific and intellectual creativity.\nAs for the political outlook, most of the debate focused on the concept of the social contract. In 1603, the Calvinist Johannes Altoseos of Holland, came out with the theory of consent as a necessary requirement for political links. This attitude was developed further later by others; particularly, by John Locke who came 80 years later. In the following years, the traditional theory of the natural law changed through adopting the theory of natural rights.\nIn 1651 Tomas Honz in his book the State or the Substance, Form and Authority of the Commonwealth: Clerical or Civil, meant to arrange a prescription for establishing an ideal state where peace and security are guaranteed. In this regard, he inserted the theory of “natural right” as opposed to “the natural law.” He had very pessimistic view with regard to the behaviors of human beings in their “natural state” before engaging in the social contract. His key principle was that people engaged in a social contract with one another because they thought that they can protect themselves better by giving all authority to a ruler.\nThe major development came with John Locke and his two treaties about the government. They were the motive behind the first memorandum of rights in 1688. He asserted the necessity of acceptance or consent as a basis for ruling and government. Human rights are equal and hence nothing can force an individual to submit to the authority of another except acceptance and consent. He obviously gave up the pessimism of Hobz; for, contrary to Hobz, he admitted that human beings are by nature free and equal and most of them abide by the natural law. Thus, the natural law constitutes and protects the rights of life, freedom, and property. It also requires man to fulfill his promises and commitments and to do his best to guarantee and secure others’ interests and welfare. We can also say that the differences between the concepts of Locke and those of Rousseau stirred conflicting concepts concerning human rights. There is a concept inspired by Locke’s thought and prevails largely over the Anglo-American world. It sees human rights, in essence, as freedom from the state. However, there is another concept that focuses on Rousseau’s thought and it largely spreads over Europe and Latin America. It not only sees human rights as freedom from the state but it demands rights from the state. This concept thus has a positive attitude toward the state as a means for general welfare.\nThe interaction between politicians and philosophers was shown also by Tomas Jefferson who found inspiration in Montesquieu and Locke’s ideas when he wrote the declaration of the independence of America. There is also the French Marquis de La Fayette who took part in the American Revolution in 1777 and was appointed as a major general. He had a big role in the army of Revolution against the English in the period 1777-1781 and when he returned to France in 1782, he was elected as a member in the Board of Classes in 1789. He was also one of those who developed the first draft of the declaration of human rights that was undoubtedly inspired by the declaration of the independence of America and by Rousseau’s works.\nIn 1791 the US approved the memorandum of rights attached to the constitution which had been approved in 1787. Part of the memorandum aimed at securing and guaranteeing the interests of the United Stated in the face of the federal authorities. Therefore, the first article included the classical human rights: freedom of religion, freedom of speech and journalism, freedom of meeting, the right to submit petitions to the government to alleviate sufferings. The fourth article was on the right of privacy and freedom from arbitrary arrest. The fifth and sixth articles were on issues related to the suitable procedures and just trials.\nMany of these rights were already in the British memorandum for rights. The American memorandum went further but could not reach the French declaration of 1789 which comprehended more rights. Nevertheless, in comparison to the French declaration, we find that the American memorandum of rights was part of a constitutional document and therefore it was immediately binding on the legal side while the French declaration did not find a solid place in the French constitutional system for more than 150 years. It was asserted as a prelude for the French constitution in 1791. But this constitution disappeared in favor for the new constitution in 1972 which abolished the royal system. In fact, the French declaration did not find an outstanding place in the French positive constitutional law until the new constitution was approved in 1946.\nNow after realizing all this, it could be said that it was Tomas Bin who crystallized the most comprehensive vision of human rights as a reaction to the gaps or shortcomings noticed by the Europeans at that time. In his book Human Rights, published in 1791 to defend the critiques of Redmond Burke concerning natural rights, he bypassed the resonant phrases of rights to analyze the reasons of anger and discontent in the European society besieged by despotic governments, the spread of poverty, and many, violent wars. In his analysis, he was supporting the democratic republic trend and was concerned with the procedures for the welfare of all and for providing relief for the poor, pensions for the aged, and education for all. He asserted that this should be achieved through imposing taxes. Thus, he supported rights that went away beyond all that was circulating in thought during those years.\nMany in the Western world refused the idea of unchangeable, established rights. Others sought to confine them to the minimum which they called the civil rights; and they had many reasons. The reaction of the conservative trends, which gained strength because of the transgressions committed by the French Revolution, drove many to oppose the idea of equality between human beings. Moreover, social reformers have found that the limited concepts of civil rights were very restrictive.\nAs for the extremists, they saw that natural rights or civil rights are but a tool employed by the bourgeoisie in its struggle with the workers’ movements.\nIn Europe, the Austrian Chancellor Prince Mitring united and coordinated efforts to secure despotic suppression so that ruling dynasties could oppress the democratic and national movements. During the period between 1815 and 1848 he attempted to establish and support a chain of international alliances across Europe against democracy.\nHe considered the efforts that were done for democratic political change in the twenties and thirties of the past century in Italy, Spain, and Germany as unhistorical and unrealistic. He claimed that those who stand by the liberal side try to take from England the theories and ideas of freedom and equality which have no historical roots in the continent. He supported the heritage and class hierarchy not equality; for systematic, organic development was necessary. He said, “A people who cannot read and write cannot make proper constitutions.”\nWe can see the period between 1800 and 1945 as a long period or stage of conflict between those who sought to keep higher authority and better privileges and those who objected to this. In Britain, voices of objection to the natural rights were raised by many. Amond Burke was impressed by the developments of the revolution in France and expressed his objection to the idea of human rights and people authority. In his book Reflections on the Revolution in France, first published in 1790, and in his other succeeding books, he took to portray in black phrases the dangers he saw in democracy when the masses would rule unbound and unguided by the responsible leadership of the inherited Aristocratic class. He viewed that rational thinking and reflective projects that aimed at reestablishing the political structure cause destruction to the capabilities and financial and spiritual sources the society acquired with effort and difficulty.\nOn the contrary, he lauded what he considered as the virtues of the English constitution with its continuity and unsystematic growth with certain rights based on the status of the individual not on abstract and equal rights. The English acceptance of the hierarchy was a positive, not negative, quality in this view.\nIn terms of the philosophy of legislation and the theory of law, the nineteenth century witnessed strong emphasis on the positive philosophy. This was started by Jermy Pentam, founder of Pragmatism in Britain. Then this philosophy was widely developed by John Austin who attempted in is book Determining the World of Legislation in 1832 to point out the difference between law and ethics, which he considered to have gone overlooked due to the principles of natural laws. He crystallized the definition of law as a sort of commands issued by a ruler accompanied by threat of deterring punishment in the case of disobedience and noncompliance. This concept contradicts completely with the theories of natural law and natural rights.\nNevertheless, the margin of democracy was limited. If John Locke considered the consent of the subjects as one of his big concerns, it was actually landlords and proprietors who kept his mind busy, not the public.\nTwo different trends emerged among those who kept supporting the principles of the fundamental freedoms and natural rights: one supports freedom with independence and the other supports freedom with participation.\nIndependence from the state has been achieved through the tools that govern and chain it; that is, through dividing authority into legislative, executive, and judiciary in accordance with the opinions suggested by Montesquieu. These are the suitable procedures and basic guarantees for the freedom of the individual and the principle of non-retroactivity in criminal issues as well as freedom from torture and protection of properties in addition to the freedom of speech within some restrictions.\nThese in brief are the most important developments the West witnessed in the past and recently in the field of human rights as results of conflicts, real wars, and broad philosophical and legal argumentation. All these events and developments that accompanied it were purely Western and on the other bank of the Mediterranean Sea- or the other side as our forefathers called Anadausia and other neighboring countries of south Europe.\nOur comment is that, for us as Muslims, many of these issues were clear-cut such as the guarantees related to judiciary system, the forbiddance of torture, and the protection of properties.\nUnlike Montesquieu’s approach of complete separation between the three authorities, according to his famous phrase in his book the Spirit of Laws “Authority stops authority”, there is the principle of cooperation between authorities which the French legist Rene Thapa called the interrelation of authorities and which appeared in the judiciary system in the form of the attorney general who represents the position of the executive authority “the government” before courts. Besides, the possibility to dissolute the parliament by the president is another manifestation of the interrelation between authorities in the Western system.\nInterrelation and cooperation between authorities to achieve justice in people’s life is closer to the Islamic concept. In addition, the legislative authority in the Western sense of absolute power to enact laws in all fields does not conform with the supremacy of the heavenly laws which gives man the right to legislate on the basis of ijtihad in certain fields that increases or decreases owing to the requirements of the shari`ah and the necessities and needs of life.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "How to Decide the Degree of Sickness?",
      "Answer": "\nWe still discuss sickness that drops the obligation of fasting. You mentioned the categories of sickness including severe, slight, and mild. But who decides to which category the sickness belong to?\nTo determine such a point, reference must be given to experts or the sick person himself. This has become clear in this age as we have doctors. The issue is how to ascertain the presence of the effective cause of the ruling; that is, to decide whether this disease remits the obligation of fasting or not. There are diseases such as diabetes or nephritis where one may not fast. It is the doctor here who determines the level of seriousness that gives license to the person or even makes it obligatory upon him to break his fasting. I should repeat the word obligatory in this context, because a lot of people are not convinced to give up fasting and think that they thus do an act of seeking nearness to Allah while they really do not, because Almighty Allah has remitted such a person from the obligation of fasting and thus breaking his fast has become the obligation he has to fulfill.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "How to Overcome the Obstacles of Convergence",
      "Answer": "\nWe present herewith religious, creedal and logical advice to establish an appropriate intellectual course of action for a less tensioned existence of Muslims in Europe. This advice looks to ensure that Muslims can live intelligently with other components to materialize the dream of a tolerant space in Europe. Theoretically, it is so; but practically there is a feeling of worry and uneasiness towards Islam due to some horrible acts performed by some Muslims. However, not all Muslims should be held responsible for this minority.\nAdvice\n1.    The spirit of ‘being in the same boat’ should prevail. This first piece of advice reflects the hadith  concerning the people of a ship. Will you be patient with coexistence?\n2.    Human rights should be respected. Would you be patient were they not respected?\n3.    Duties have to be fulfilled. A Muslim has a duty toward his country.\n4.    Virtuous manners should be activated, such as caring for neighbors, helping the needy, dedication, altruism, and justice. Will you be patient with this, brother?\n5.    We should hasten to do good, without waiting for a neighbor to take the initiative.\n6.    We should not wait for thanks from our neighbor.\n7.    We should look for reasonable concepts to constitute a code of ethics.\nEurope has a history of multiplicity and experience acquired from the love of peace and suffering in war. It has the ability of innovation, philosophical heritage, and human thought inherited from all Hellenic, Romanic, Jewish, Christian and, finally, Islamic components. Whoever doubts this should revisit George Sarton’s book An Introduction to the History of Science, where the author proves that Muslims lifted the banner of science from 750 to 1100 AC.\nOver the years, Jabir ibn Hayyan, Al-Khwarizmi, Al-Razi, Abu al-Wafa al-Bayroni, Ibn Sina, Ibn al-Haytham, and Umar al-Khayyam all belonged to the culture of the Muslim nation. Then, western names began to appear, such as Girard and Beacon. But over 250 years of glory was shared by Ibn Rushd, Naseer al-Deen al-Tusi, and Ibn al-Nafees. This last thinker preceded Harvey in his theory concerning blood circulation. It is Islam that has tolerance, broadness in the circle of its creed, flexibility of its practices, different interpretations, belief in all heavenly messages, acceptance of the other and acknowledgement of differences.\nTherefore, scholars have to enlighten Muslims about the tolerance of their religion. They must search for texts and historical practices that enhance tolerance and coexistence through providing more appropriate explanations that support the goals of such norms. This would prove the richness of Shari`ah (“Islamic law”), which considers positive integration attainable. Europeans also have something to learn about Islam in order to form a clear vision about its tolerance. They must appreciate Muslims’ eligibility to be good citizens and avoid the stereotypical outlook.\nTo be frank, we should say to Muslims: You have two problems, firstly, the stereotypical image that people have of Islam, owing to the terrorist attacks of 11th September and their subsequent events. Secondly, this distorted image has branded you with terrorism, in addition to many other groups that contributed to impute it to Muslims. You have to exert more effort in two directions:\n1.    Clear your ranks of terrorism, terrorists, and violent movements. Teach your youth the facts of their religion and their interests. In the European Council for Fatwa and Research for instance, we and the International Union of Muslim Scholars exert doubled efforts.\n2.    Make effort to improve your image and break the generalizing stereotype that is fed through the media and other means of communication. The heart of this problem lies in the discriminating attitudes of some European, western circles. Some organizations feel uneasy with your very existence and take up negative stances toward you.\nLooking at this problem from another aspect, wars that take place in some Islamic territories provoke further prejudices with unconvincing reasons. But we have to deal with the matter with a sense of responsibility. We should not to be content with it, but instead learn how to express our anger in a rational way that suits our religion and our civilization. So, how should we manage our differences? How should we express our anger without doing wrong to innocents or to ourselves and our countries where we live? How do we do so without terrorist acts of grave and evil consequences?\nIn our heritage there are means of peaceful expressions of anger. In one hadith, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) ordered an angry person to sit if he was standing and to lie down if he was sitting so that he should not commit an act of foolishness in the state of anger. This, of course, does not exonerate the components of European society from their responsibility to understand Muslims. Nor can they shirk the responsibility of avoiding unfair generalization. Instead, they must deal with them as citizens of full rights, respect their religion, and create an amiable cultural and social atmosphere that allows Muslims to crystallize themselves within the European matrix without feeling alienated. The worst thing we fear of is the reciprocal and desperate demonization.\nFinally, we quote Jacob’s words to his sons “O my sons! Go you and enquire about Yusuf (Joseph) and his brother, and never give up hope of Allah’s mercy. Certainly, no one despairs of Allah’s mercy, except the people who disbelieve.” (Yusuf 12:87)\nThere must be partnership to prepare a project for rescue and salvation. One hand can never clap. Scholars are therefore ready to present a culture of tolerance from Islam. We expect all active organizations in the West to interact with them. Turkey and Britain should also promote and interact with this. The only alternative of this project will be the acceleration of hatred within the European house.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Hajj: Lessons &#038; Reflections",
      "Answer": "\nHajj (i.e., pilgrimage) is one of the five pillars of Islam, as stated in the Sahih hadith: “Islam is built on five pillars… and Hajj to the Sacred House of Allah (i.e., the Kaaba) for those who can afford it”.\nIt is a religious obligation according to the Qur’an and Sunnah. Allah says, {And Hajj to the House (i.e., the Kaaba) is a duty that humankind owes to Allah, only those who can afford its expenses}. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “O people, Hajj is prescribed for you, so perform Hajj”.\nHajj is one of the most sublime acts of worship, and it is the legacy of Ibrahim (peace be upon him), Father of the Prophets and the Khalil (i.e., close friend) of Allah. Allah says to Ibrahim,{And proclaim to people Hajj. They will come to you afoot and on every lean camel, coming from every distant pass}.\nThe nation of Prophet Muhammad has inherited this act as the fifth pillar of its faith. It was prescribed in the fifth year of Hegira, as stated by Ibn Sa’d in his compilation At-Tabaqat (The Classes). He wrote that Dimam Ibn Tha`labah came to the Prophet in the fifth year of Hegira and was taught the obligations of religion, including “performing Hajj to the House if you can afford it”.\nHajj is a basic ceremony and obligation in Islam, and whoever denies its being a religious duty on Muslims, when its conditions are met, shall be deemed out of the fold of Islam, as unanimously held by Muslim scholars.\nAllah, Exalted be He, has promised a great reward for those who perform Hajj duly and observe its rituals and instructions. One of the best benefits of Hajj is abolition of the pilgrim’s sins, according to the Prophet’s words: “Whoever performs Hajj to this House and does not have sexual intercourse (with his wife) or commit evil (during Hajj) will come out sinless just like he was when his mother gave birth to him”.\nIt is not our purpose here to elaborate on the rituals of Hajj or to explain its four pillars without which it shall be rendered invalid: Ihram, stay at Mount Arafa, Ifadah Circumambulation, and going between Safa and Marwa (which is controversial). Nor is it intended to dwell on the rulings pertaining to Hajj; its duties that, when missed, are compensated for with sacrifice; things prohibited, undesirable, desirable, or supererogatory during the state of Ihram\nWe will limit our discussion exclusively to trying to throw light on some spiritual implications that would draw the attention of whoever contemplates this ceremony.\nThe season of Hajj is a great and unique Islamic event that has no equivalent in any other nation throughout history. It is like a grand world conference. Actually, Hajj can be considered as one of the main characteristics of this nation and a ceremony in which it stands matchless.\nThe first and most striking thing in Hajj is the universality that manifests itself in the perfect way, with millions of pilgrims of all nationalities, languages, cultures, and colors associated only by the bond of faith. It is a voluntary globalization that is not imposed by any world power.\nAnother magnificent aspect is such unity that transcends all nationalistic, sectarian, and political differences, embodying common feelings, common symbols, common rituals, and common holy places. What does this mean? And how what does it have to do with Hajj?\n– Feelings: All pilgrims have the same feelings of need for and submission to the Almighty Lord.\n– Slogans: All pilgrims wear the same white clothing and utter the same Talbiyah.\n– Rituals: All pilgrims perform the same practices in the same manner, including Ihram, staying at Mount Arafa, stay at Mina, pebble-throwing, circumambulation, etc.\n– Holy Places: All pilgrims visit the same places, such as Mount Arafa, Muzdalifah, Mina, and Mecca.\nThe third characteristic of Hajj is equality that removes all distinctions and advantages, leaving no difference between the rich and the poor, a king and a riffraff, a leader and a subordinate. All pilgrims wear a few riyals’ worth of clothes, have the same tents for accommodation at Mina, receive the same provision, and pick up the same pebbles from Muzdalifah to throw them at Mina.\nAll such aspects strengthen within pilgrims a sense of solidarity, cooperation, and true human brotherhood, filling them with a spirit of faith, modesty, and benevolence. Such a great congregation requires exceptional arrangements to be able to perform the rituals in an atmosphere of serenity, peace of mind, and spiritual and physical wellbeing.\nIn this respect, we highly appreciate the great responsibility undertaken by the King and government of Saudi Arabia, as Hajj is an act of worship that can be exercised only under a lawful and respected authority. It is an occasion where people from all over the world gather, some of whom seek to perform worship, and some others seek to commit evils. There will always be good people and bad people, and without such regulating authority, good people will fall victim to bad people and the ceremony of Hajj will lose its essence. There cannot be peace of mind amid fear or devotion amid insecurity. The Prophet (peace be upon him) urged for peacefulness and security. In a long hadith describing Prophetic Hajj, Jabir said that the Prophet gestured the people to get quiet and at ease (Reported by Muslim).\nTherefore, security of pilgrims is hugely important. And we are bound to commend the efforts made by Saudi government to secure comfortable and smooth settings for pilgrims, which has been a tradition of Saudi Arabia ever since the time of King Abdul-Aziz, as documented by historians. In his Ar-Rihlah Al-Hijaziyyah (Journey to Hejaz), Shakib Arslan wrote, “Security prevailed in the time of Ibn Saud to an extent that no one would look forward to more but would rather hope that this blessing will last”. This is the first norm in Saudi Arabia’s policy in service of the Two Sacred Mosques: security.\nThe second norm is the infrastructural development that has exceeded all expectations. The latest Mecca Sacred Mosque expansion project, executed under the auspices of the Guardian of the Two Sacred Mosques, was the largest of its kind. The expanded sanctuary is now around 328,000 sq m in area, to ensure more capacity for the growing numbers of pilgrims. Also, the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina has been redoubled several times in area and equipped with modern electronic facilities.\nThe list of achievements continues to include the fireproof tent project, which utilizes the most state-of-the-art technologies to serve pilgrims, as well as a cluster of hotels around the Two Sacred Mosques and everywhere in Mecca and Medina.\nThese are just examples of the great work done in Saudi Arabia, and we ask Allah to grant that country permanent prosperity and abundant blessings, to guide its leaders to good, and to reward them with the best.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Giving a Covenant of Security to Non-Muslims",
      "Answer": "\nIs it permissible for the ruler to give the non-Muslims a covenant of security to be under the protection of the Muslims, though they came to our countries to kill other Muslims? May Allah reward you.\nAll praise is due to Allah alone. Peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah. This question needs delineation: First, if we are to be sincere to the Muslims, we should lay emphasis on some points: the ruler is authorized to give security pledges and covenants to all or some of the non-muslims, because he is responsible for considering any benefits or harm, facilitating the first and keeping away the latter. This point is beyond any controversy. In this regard one can refer to books such as al-Mughny by Ibn Qudamah, the explanation of the Quran by al-Qurtuby, and others. It is not a condition that the one who rules over the Muslims be observant of the night Prayer or voluntary fasting. It is enough that he gains power through people’s swearing alliance and obedience to him (bay`ah), being the crown prince (wilayat al-`ahd), or taking power by force. This is the juristic position of ahl al-Sunnah (those who adhere to the Sunnah). Such a ruler can give a security pledge without any time limit based on his consideration of the interests of the public. This is the first point I wanted to make clear.\nThe second point is that when the ruler gives a pledge of security, we should assume that he intends to achieve some benefit; because people should be considered to be basically peaceful and honest, not aggressive. Thus, we should believe that they made any pledge for some benefit that the people may have been unaware of; namely, it could have been unavailable or unclear to the people, either to achieve a benefit or to avoid some harm. So let us construe their deeds this way. The third point is that if we presume the truthfulness of the questioner’s words who said that they (the unbelievers) had the intention to kill the Muslims, such a covenant would not be permissible. But at the same time this does not give permission for the questioner to rebel against the ruler and launch a war against both the Muslims and the non-Muslims. Therefore, we ask: What is the result of this covenant of security? Is it to prevent killing and fighting? We advice the questioner to be occupied only about his own concerns and to busy himself with worshiping Almighty Allah and amending his religious and worldly affairs, and not to drive himself or others into a whirlwind that will bring nothing but the destruction of his religious and worldly affairs, and the loss of this world and the Hereafter. We give this sincere advice for the sake of Almighty Allah who said, “So fear Allah as much as you can” And the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “Whoever among you sees an evil practice ought to change it with his hand. If he cannot, let it be with his tongue….” [Reported by Muslim (49)] What does “If he cannot” mean? It means: If changing the evil with your hand will lead to disastrous consequences, change it with your tongue. Moreover, if your tongue will lead to corruption and enormous losses, you may change it with your heart, particularly with regard to matters that you cannot be fully aware of. You said that they had the intention to kill Muslims. Who told you that they had this intention? We advice our young men, as well as all the Muslims, to be wise and not to become hardheaded. They should not entertain ill thoughts or become engaged in a series of violence and a whirlwind of destruction that destroys the homes of the Muslims’ themselves and may not cause any great harm to the non-muslims. For Muslims will then kill one another and will kill those under the pledge of security whose killing Allah has prohibited and whom Allah has protected their blood from the Muslims. This is our advice. Almighty Allah knows best\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Gatherings for the Remembrance of Allah",
      "Answer": "\nDear Sheikh,\n“I live in Sri Lanka and wondered if it was acceptable for the Muslim community here to gather for the sake of remembering Allah as a congregation?”\nThe Answer:\nThis is a controversial issue amongst the scholars. Some saw gatherings for the purpose of reciting Qur’an and the remembrance of Allah [in a group] as innovation, and there were others who saw it as something venerable. Each and every one of these scholars relied on certain proofs and evidences. Some relied on the statement of Ibn Mas’ud* [may Allah be pleased with him] “Indeed, you have brought an evil innovation”, and there were others who relied on the apparent [meaning of] the statement of the Prophet [may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him] who said, “No people gather together, in one of the homes from the houses of Allah, reciting the Qur’an and studying it amongst themselves, except tranquility descends upon them, they are shrouded in mercy, the angels envelop them with their wings and Allah makes mention of them in front of those who are with Him.” [related by Muslim #2699]. So, the explicit meaning of this hadith directs towards the permissibility of such gatherings. Imam al-Awza’i [may Allah have mercy upon him] was asked about gatherings, after the Dawn prayer, that included congregational studying and the remembrance of Allah [meaning they did so with one voice not silently]. He responded, “There is nothing wrong with such gatherings.” Al-Awza’I said, “Hassan bin ‘Atiyyah informed me that the first person to start this practice was Hisham bin Ismail al-Makhzomi during the caliphate of Abdul Malik bin Marawan and he was criticized for it.”\nThere were some who rejected what Hisham had done, such as Imam Malik [may Allah have mercy upon him], and there were others who said, “There is no problem with this.” Harb mentioned that he saw the people of Damascus, Hims and Basra gathering together to recite the Qur’an after the Dawn prayer. However, the people of Sham would read the Qur’an together with one loud voice, while the people of Basra and Mecca would gather and one person would read ten verses while the people would remain silent. After the first person finished, they others would read what he had read until they would complete what he had recited. Harb, commenting on this said, “All of this is excellent and pleasing.”\nRegarding Sri Lanka, then I tend to lead towards the opinion that such an action is fine. If the Muslims gather there, from time to time, to study and recite the Qur’an [together], or to remember Allah [together], without there being any forbidden acts such as mixing between the sexes, dancing or any type of evil, then it is good, and it is incumbent to avoid making [the observance of such acts] difficult upon them.\nDr. Abdullah Bin Bayyah\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Friendship Between a Muslim and a Christian",
      "Answer": "\nQ – What is the ruling of the shari`ah concerning friendship between a Muslim and a Christian? Let me point out that it involves neither pledge of alliance nor disobedience to Allah. I always talk to my Christian friend about Islam and she shows interest, though I believe that her conversion to Islam will not be easy. Allah knows best.\nA- All praise is due to Allah. There is no harm in this, insha’ Allah (if Allah so wills). Almighty Allah said “Allah does not forbid you from [honorable relationships with] those who have not fought you over your religion, nor expelled you from your dwellings – that you relate kindly and equitably with them. Indeed, Allah loves those who are just.” According to the majority of scholars, this verse is perspicuous and is not abrogated. Thus, it is virtuous to treat them kindly and equitably. This indicates that friendship is permissible as long as this does not involve loving them for their creed. With regard to building relationships based on worldly matters, Almighty Allah orders kind treatment to unbelieving parents “And keep company with both of them in this world, in accordance with what is right.” [31:15] In an authentic hadith, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to Asma’, when her unbelieving mother came to her: “Have good ties with your mother.” [Reported by al-Bukhary (2620) and Muslim (1003)] Thus, if the relation and friendship are not in matters of creed, they are not considered to be from the alliance forbidden by Almighty Allah. Therefore, there is nothing wrong in this relationship, provided that you have a good intention and you attempt to guide here and help her by being a good example and having good manners. This, rather, will be a form of calling others to Islam. Allah knows best.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Freedom as a Human Right",
      "Answer": "\nThis valuable word that poets eulogized and wise men recommended and for which bloods have been shed is derived from the word “hurr (free)” which, according to the Arabs, is an antonym to “salve” denoting the person who has full control over his affairs. But he is also the person who has good manners; because the word “free” in Arabic –and language represents values- denotes the best of everything. It also indicates good work and favorable deed.\nTarafah said:\nLet not your love be an malignant disease. This is not good from you, Mawyy.\nFreedom for Arabs denotes also having perfect qualities.\nMukhees ibn Arta’ah al-Tameemy said:\nI said to him: Avoid everything that may hold you blamable, for the free man is free.\nBashshar ibn Burd said:\nHe was placed at the summit of virtues by a soul that is free and deserves ample clarification\nIn the light of the linguistic definition we can deduce that freedom in the Arabic concept denotes release and possession of will but with righteous word and noble manner. No wonder that freedom could turn to be wrongdoing if it does not wear the garment of virtuous manners. Thus it becomes worthy of the words of the French Madam Rolland who said when she saw the violations of the French Revolution under the banner of freedom “O freedom! How many crimes have been committed in your name!”\nFreedom is parallel to and matches equality. Therefore, the erudite scholar Ibn `Ashour considered it, in a sense, as a result of it in his book al-Maqasid where he underscored equality in the following way: Equality in legislation for the ummah (Muslim nation) takes in consideration people’s equality in creation and its ramifications on the basis of which distinction has no effect with regard to the welfare of the world. People are equal in terms of humanity “You all belong to Adam” and in terms of the right to live in this world according to natural disposition. Their difference in color, form, race, and home country should have no effect in this regard.\nThis gave rise to their equality in the fundamentals of legislation, such as the right to live known as the preservation of soul and the preservation of posterity, and in the means of living known as the preservation of property. Equality in legislation is a basic principle that never fails unless for the existence of an impediment. Thus to prove equality in legislation between individuals and kinds we do not need to look for a reason; for the absence of any impediment is enough. The Quranic address in the masculine gender comprehends women without any need to change pronouns and forms. The non Muslim’s equality to the Muslim in most of the rights is a basic principle- as expressed by the hadith that reads “They have [the rights] that we have and upon them are [the duties] that are upon us”- and is one of the objectives of the shari`ah.\nAl-Taher ibn `Ashour approves the interrelation between freedom and equality as he considers the first as a result for the latter: “As equality is one of the objectives of the shari`ah, this necessarily entails that the individuals of the ummah should be equal in the way they deal with their personal affairs, which is a basic objective of the shari`ah known as freedom.”\nThus freedom is used as opposite to servitude which means inability to take decision.\nThe second meaning is to enable a person to deal freely with his personal affairs as he likes without objection.\nBoth meanings of freedom are intended by the shari`ah, for both are based on the human natural disposition. Both achieve the meaning of equality which has been established as one of the objectives of the shari`ah. He quoted as evidence the famous word of `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) and he explained such freedom by being naturally free. From the first meaning appeared the famous fiqh rule that “the Lawgiver aims for freedom.” This is based on surveying the lawgiver’s attitudes that have indicated that one of the most important objectives of the shari`ah is to abolish slavery and to spread freedom. But the shari`ah observes graduation in treatment along with the preservation of the system.\nHence, Islam has combined between the objectives of spreading freedom and preserving the general system by giving the reasons of freedom supremacy over the reasons of slavery which it reduced to the minimum and prescribed treatment to the remaining. Islam abolished many of the reasons of slavery such as one’s selling of his children and enslaving the criminals as practiced by the Arabs and the creditors as practiced by the Romans and as found in the Solon’s Greek laws and in the Torah. In chapter 4 of the Kings 2, a woman came to complain for Prophet Elijah that her husband died and the usurer came to take two of her children for the debt. This indicates that enslaving people for debts was in the laws of Moses (peace be upon him).\nOnly enslaving war prisoners remained as reciprocal treatment. But many are the reasons of ending it. One of the avenues of spending Zakah-charity is to emancipate slaves. Emancipation has been made among the obligatory compensations. General exhortations have been issued to emancipate slaves and the treatment of the salve has been changed. Even bad treatment has been made a reason for obligatory emancipation.\nThus, surveying these procedures it becomes clear that the shari`ah aims at emancipating slaves. Muslims emancipated many slaves and from among them were masters, imams, scholars and masters of the recitations of the Quran (the great seven masters of the recitations of the Quran were freed slaves except two).\nOver history there were incidents of collective emancipation as happened in Morocco in the 11th century during the reign of king Islam`eel of Morocco by a fatwa from scholars on the basis of the rule that “the lawgiver’s aims for emancipation.” (See in this regard al-Isteqsa fi Khabar al-Maghrib al-Aqsa.)\nAs for freedom in the second sense, it has many manifestations including freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and of practicing ijtihad, the principle of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and the thriving of different opinions.\nIn the first three centuries of Islamic history scholars spread their fatwas and schools of juristic opinions and each group supported their opinion with evidences. This never gave rise to bad feelings or rancor. Jurists themselves were keen to give opportunity to those who disagree with their opinions. Abu Ja`far al-Mansour offered to force people to adopt Malik’s book al-Muwatta’ to abide by it. He said, “O Malik! I would like to make copies of your books and send them to each country commanding them to act according to them and never to go beyond them.” Imam Malik said, “O Commander of the Believers! Do not do this, for other opinions have reached people and they heard other hadiths; and thus each group adopted what they received from among the different opinions of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) and others. In fact, it is difficult to turn them away from this. So leave people and what they have.”\nThis is a wonderful attitude that shows this imam’s keenness to preserve freedom of opinion and the practice of ijtihad. This attitude has made him issue a fatwa concerning the oaths of paying homage to the ruler that the divorce of the one under coercion is not enforceable. This incurred the wrath of the sultan upon him in addition to the punishment which he suffered but did not take back his opinion.\nMahmoud Ameen al-`Alim holds the view that freedom is actually a determination and a necessity because it is to have choice between possibilities. When it is a necessity and a determination, it also necessitates diversity, exchangeability, and open possibilities. Besides, it includes interactive relation between awareness, which is the result of interaction and interrelation between diverse necessities, and the external objective necessity. Therefore, freedom has two aspects: one is internal concerning its origin as a will based on internal interactive and interrelated necessities including motives, derives , inclinations, and the like whose interrelation gives rise to the manifestation of the will as an inevitable psychological and factorial phenomenon. But, at the same time, freedom has external aspect, which is to be aware of the necessities and to choose between them. In the external aspect it is an active process to control the external status quo in any form such as possession, direction, rejection, or the like.\nThe world has no single meaning for freedom. The meanings of freedom are closely related to the social system that produce them. Aristotle’s concept of freedom did not come from Aristotle’s mind but from the society that despised hand working. Rousseau formed the meaning of freedom on the basis of the collapse of feudal system and the rise of the capitalist system in the stage of monopoly and the meaning of freedom changed to a call for dissolution, degeneration, and loss of relation and direction.\nFreedom and equality have been mentioned together in the International Declaration of Human Rights. So, their relation, as philosophy and politics showed, is worthy of discussion to serve as a background for these concepts in the law of human rights.\nWe can handle three meanings of the many that freedom has, according to some commentators of the declaration: one is that man enjoys a wide range of the available important choices [or opportunities].\nSecond is that man is independent from others in terms of his decisions concerning how to benefit from these choices.\nThird is that man is free to determine his values and priorities and to live adhering to them.\nEquality can be understood in the same way. Man can enjoy a wide range of the available important opportunities equally just as others and he is equally free to determine his values and priorities.\nFreedom here is temporarily perceived- in the individual sense- as perceived by the Western liberal thought in the ninth century.\nMr. Subhy al-Mahmasany talked about responsible freedom saying, “Freedom is not chaos. It is restricted by others’ rights as well as by the public interest. Overall, the concept of freedom has never been constantly the same. It has differed much owing to people’s generations, circumstances, hopes, and ambitions.\nThus if we wan to define freedom in general, we can say that it is a permission to do something or to refrain from doing it without violating the rights of others or breaking the laws. Hence, as long as freedom is restricted by the law, it is relative and cannot be true unless the law is just or is restricted by a just constitution and targets the public system without turning to be despotism and tyranny.”\nConcerning the balance between freedom and equality, al-Mahmasany views that establishing the rights of equality and freedom in the positive civil law was a result of an accurate balance between the individual’s interest and the society’s interest. On the one side, the individual inclines to freedom but this freedom may lead to inequality. Therefore, the interest of the society requires, on the other hand, that this freedom be restricted and that a minimum of equality be secured.\nIn other words, the history of human rights has been a constant effort to balance between freedom and equality, between the individual and the society, and between human values and social justice.\nWe may mention here some freedoms that people ask about:\nFirst: It is not permissible in the shari`ah to detain someone or deprive him of his freedom without a legitimate right. The accused person is innocent until proven guilty. This is the position of the majority of jurists. One scholar, however, has set some restrictions to protect the interest of the society. According to his view, freedom should not be restricted in the case of unproven accusation except with regulations which he summarized in three categories of accused persons:\n– a person who has good reputation and is not under suspicion should not be imprisoned or his freedom be restricted until the end of investigation as long as there is no strong evidence to his involvement in the crime.\n– the person who has precedent crimes should be remanded until he is proven innocent.\n– the person who is unknown should be detained until investigations are finished.\nThere is also the freedom of making contracts which is also established in the Islamic shari`ah. In a noble hadith we read, “Muslims are bound by their conditions with the exception of a condition that makes something lawful unlawful or something unlawful lawful.” This hadith is quite acceptable due to its supportive narrations as indicated by ibn Taymiyyah.\nThis freedom, in particular, entails the execution of the conditions of contracts. The universal principle dictates “A condition must be met as far as possible.”\nJuristic schools differed over determining the conditions that are valid and those that are void or invalid. But the majority of jurists, including the Malikites and the Hanbilites, particularly Ibn Taymiyyah and ibn al-Qayyem, held the view that the basic principle with regard to contracts and conditions is their permissibility and validity with the exception of those which the Lawgiver explicitly mentioned as prohibited. Lengthy chapters were dedicated for this. Ibn al-Qayyem said, “The basic principle with regard to contracts and conditions is their validity with the exception of that which the Lawgiver declared as void and forbad from it. This is the correct opinion.” Then he repeated, “The basic principle with regard to contracts and transactions is their validity until an evidence to their invalidity and unlawfulness is established.”\nAl-Mahmasany drew attention to the misuse of the right of freedom saying about demonstration, “Concerning the issue of demonstration, just like other issues, freedom could be misused. In reality we have seen, especially in democratic countries where freedoms are active, the demonstrations of workers and students take such big forms that resemble internal revolutions.”\nHe added, “If the purpose of the demonstration is mere refusal or the misuse of freedom to demolish the regime and the existing institutions away from the legitimate democratic ways or if the demonstrations is a sort of pressure practiced by the wild minority against the peaceful, mindful majority or if they are directed by foreign or suspected elements or if the purpose is to make crimes, riots, or illegal acts, in all these cases and the like demonstrations are no longer signs for healthy democracy or national maturity. They rather lead to lose active energies and valuable time through distracting them from procuring knowledge and from useful production and diverting them from understating the national and social responsibilities.”\nIn addition to the misuse of freedom he mentioned we see other sorts of misuse of the freedom of opinion and speech in the form of blatant declaration of disbelief and reviling of the religion.\nIslam does not question people’s inner thoughts or what they have in their homes. But to spread apostasy on public by those who are called the fifth column or the agents of other civilizations goes against the general system in the Muslim society and has its suitable punishment in the Islamic penalties. I really wonder of those people who approve the criminality of speaking insolently against the president or the king or the government and do not criminalize speaking insolently against the Creator –exalted and majestic is He- which also represents insolence to more than billion persons.\nSecond: Freedom of speech sometimes becomes obligatory when it is a kind of calling others to goodness enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil or if the purpose is to demand justice publicly. In a Quranic noble verse we read “So let there be of you on [united] community calling to all that is good and enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong. And it is these who are truly successful.”\nIn a noble hadith we read, “The best jihad (strive for the sake of Allah) is to say a word of truth before an unjust ruler.” In another hadith we read, “He of you who sees something wrong has to change it with his hand. If he cannot, let him do this with his tongue. If he cannot, let him do this with his tongue; and this is the weakest level of faith.” Acting upon this, many of the imams and leading scholars- including Malik and Ahmad in Hanbal- were reported to have been courageous and adherent to their creed and opinion in spite of the oppression and torture by those in authority.\nThird: With regard to freedom of opinion, undoubtedly in Islam freedom of opinion has restrictions and methodological regulations as related to the given postulates and the approaches to reach the truth in addition to the necessity of sincere intention to achieve public benefit. Otherwise, it would turn to be fallacies, delusions, and selfishness. There are also ethical restrictions such as truthfulness in conveying the opinion and observing excellent manners when convincing others. The freedom we approve in this context is the one that has such regulations and restrictions.\nIslamic teachings has established the freedom of speech not as a permissible right of the Muslim but as an obligation as well.\nDue to the many strict demands concerning it, we can see it ranking as a necessity in the hierarchy of shari`ah objectives. It is a necessary objective of the shari`ah as some person said.\nFinally, if legists and philosophers have not agreed on one concept of freedom and referred this disagreement to times and generations considering it something relative as the erudite scholar subhy al-Mahmasany said- and sometimes it is even a call for dissolution, degeneration, and disunity as Mahmoud al-`Ali said- freedom in Islam is governed by the major principles outlined by the Quran and the Sunnah according to which Muslim communities have to adapt themselves to find a suitable ground where freedoms can flourish, rights are protected, talents come forth, and creativity radiates in the context of civilizational religious values and the criteria of justice, fairness, reason and wisdom.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

This hadith was reported by Al-Bukhari under Chapter on Rulings, Section on Translating for Rulers & Whether One Translator Is Enough. This is a major purpose of learning foreign languages. As the questioner said, learning other languages would help future generations disseminate Islam, confute accusations laid by enemies against Islam, understand their thought and viewpoints, know their plans and attitudes towards the Muslim nation, and benefit from the useful knowledge they have.\nAccordingly, there is no impediment to this, and it would deserve divine reward if the work is done properly and is consecrated for the Sake of Allah.\n\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Extremists Are Allies of Pro-Americanisation",
      "Answer": "\nSheikh Abdullah Bin Bayyah stressed that extremists and fanatics are allies of the Americanisation trend, pointing out that the dialogue is not new to Muslims and that difference among scholars leads to tolerance and magnanimity. The Messenger (peace be upon him) engaged in dialogue with the people of Al-Hudaybiyah despite what they did to him. Bin Bayyah described the outcome of the dialogue conducted with the West as being of “little, but important, benefit”. In his lecture entitled “Human Rights: Remote Dialogue” delivered as part of the events of Riyadh Book Fair yesterday evening, Bin Bayyah shed light on the objectives of the dialogue, mentioning that the dialogue “is a pattern of resistance and confrontation of this unjust campaign against Islam and Muslims, which is trying to get it out of the cultural context and depicting Muslims as devils.”\nIn this regard, Bin Bayyah said: “We are not devils or infallible angels, but we are part of the Islamic civilization. In addition, dialogue provides the rule of difference as a golden rule for human coexistence.” He noted, “We want to be part of civilization, but with our own particulars, and we seek to integrate the values, rather than attack them.”\nHe drew attention to the importance of establishing a “union of the good people” with those possessing sound mind. Bin Bayyah added that among the objectives of dialogue is that we should “call to the fact that we represent history and we own history, as `Umar bin Al-Khattab and Saladin entered Jerusalem, so it is possible to balance and compare our judgment to theirs.”\nThen, Sheikh Bin Bayyah moved to address the obstacles of dialogue, pointing to the gap in the West between word and action, as “they say that which they do not do”. The problem lies in the partiality represented in the search for interest only. After that, he talked about women’s rights, pointing out that women’s dignity and respect are incontestable in Islam, as both men and women are equal in rights and duties, and stressing that women are the basis of all virtues.\nAfterwards, Bin Bayyah stated that he was asked about women’s assumption of presidency in Indonesia if this is achieved through elections, and his answer was “let them till the wind of elections dissuade them”.\nBin Bayyah also tackled the issue of the permissibility for a woman who has become a Muslim to stay with her disbelieving husband, basing his opinion on the words of Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, saying, “A woman staying as a Muslim is better for her than forcing her to leave her disbelieving husband, if this may lead to her apostasy.” This is the legal fatwa issued by the European Council, which goes against the opinion of all Fiqhi councils. He expressed his willingness to discuss and go back if it turns out to be a wrong opinion. Bin Bayyah stressed that the punishment of the apostate is “contradictory to universal human rights”, noting that we agree with the trend that calls for justice and peace and we do not approve of dissolution and melting, nor isolation and breakoff with others.\nSheikh Bin Bayyah pointed out that extremists and fanatics are the allies of the Americanisation trend.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Is it permissible for someone who is not old (in his thirties) to dye his hair black? I am aware of the Hadith that orders Muslims to change the color of their hair when it is white, but I heard that the phrase “but not black” is part of the Hadith. I also heard other narrations and opinions of scholars that allow dying the hair with black.

      "Answer": "\nIs it permissible for someone who is not old (in his thirties) to dye his hair black? I am aware of the Hadith that orders Muslims to change the color of their hair when it is white, but I heard that the phrase “but not black” is part of the Hadith. I also heard other narrations and opinions of scholars that allow dying the hair with black. I have another question about a white substance that regains the natural color of the person’s hair with repeated use without having any dyes in it. Is it permissible to use it?\nScholars are of three opinions regarding dying the hair black. One opinion allows it, the other dislikes it, and the third prohibits it. Each group has proofs supporting its view. One Hadith is the one you mentioned narrated by Abu Quhafah (may Allah be pleased with him) where the Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered grey hair to be changed and said, “but not black”. Most scholars consider this Hadith a proof of undesirability and not prohibition. This is the opinion of Imam Malik, Abu Hanifah, Imam Ahmad as stated in Al-Mughni book, and most of the Shafi`i scholars. Only Imam Al-Nawawi supported the prohibition. Another scholar who believed in the permissibility is the Hanafi scholar Abu Yusuf who gave some explanations to Risalat ibn Abu Zaid with certain restrictions. A group of the Companions dyed their hair with black such as `Uthman, Al-Hasan, and Al-Husain (may Allah be pleased with them all). Among the Followers who dyed their hair black are Ibn Sirin and Abu Burdah. Ibn Al-Jawzi compiled a paper in this regard entitled Husn Al-Khitab fy Al-Shaib wal-Khidab. Generally, it is permissible unless a man is deceiving a woman into marrying him. But if he is already married and his wife knows the color of his hair, there is no harm in dying his grey hair to look nice for her, especially in the case of the inquirer, who is still young. Dying the hair black is not desirable for old men. That is why some scholars thought it is prohibited, considering the case of Abu Quhafah (may Allah be pleased with him). Please refer to Fath Al-Bari by Al-Hafizh Ibn Hajar and other books of Sunnah and Fiqh. Finally, Allah knows best!\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Eating in a Place that Serves Alcohol?",
      "Answer": "\nThe Question:\n“Is it allowable for me to eat in an establishment where alchohol is served?”\nThe Answer:\nThe origin [related to this act] is that a Muslim is not allowed to sit at a table where alcohol is served as found in a sound hadith related by Imam Ahmed and Imam al-Tirmithi. However, this type of prohibition is from the prohibitions related to means about which Ibn al-Qayyim said, “Indeed, the prohibitions related to means are not the same as the prohibitions related to objectives*.The prohibitions related to means are made permissible in the face of needs and the prohibitions related to objectives are only permissible in the presence of necessities.” Thus, this [act of sitting at a table were alcohol is served] is from the prohibitions related to means.\nSome of the scholars stated that the prohibitions related to means are from the makhrohat [disliked acts]. Therefore, if one needs to sit in such a restaurant, he should not sit at a table where alcohol is served, and if he does, he should not do so in the presence of his small children who could be affected by it. If one needs to take food from such a restaurant, and he cannot find any other place to take his food, then this issue is one that rests upon hardship, difficulty and a sincere need. Thus, in the presence of the prohibition [the hadith alluded to above] this order could be understood to be disliked or [an absolute] prohibition. However, it is from the prohibitions related to needs, means and necessities whose rulings are lifted [made permissible] in the face of sincere needs as Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned.\nDr. Abdullah bin Bayyah\n*the difference between muharamat al-wasail [prohibitions related to means] and muharamt al-maqasid [prohibitions related to aims/objectives] is that the former, although forbidden, are considered lesser in weight than the latter as the former are related to causes, where as the latter are related to an actual forbidden act. Thus, sitting at the table, although not the same as drinking, could lead to it whereas drinking in itself is absolutely forbidden.\nThe difference between Hajat [needs] and Daruriyyat [necessities] was discussed in great detail by al-Shatibi D. 691 A.H in his monumental work al-Muwafaqat. He states that Daruriyyat are things whose absence would cause life to cease, and hajjat are things that one needs to function comfortably but in their absence one would experience some hardship.

After I have the predawn meal and go to bed, I feel like something comes up to my throat. Does this break my fast?\n If this sour substance does not reach the throat, it is nothing. If one involuntarily vomits, there will be nothing upon him. But if he intentionally vomits, he will have to make the day up. It is just that one sometimes feels of something sour which he has no control over. He is not obliged to do anything, if he has no control over it and nothing comes out.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Donations to Non-Muslim Organizations",
      "Answer": "\nYour eminence Sheikh! We are students who were sent to study in a Western country. We are responsible for an Islamic society in the university where we study. A number of the Muslims in the city (who are already few) have clothes and other things to donate. But there is no Muslim in our town who deserves such donations. We called a number of other Islamic societies in other towns but they could not come to us. From previous experience, we know that sending these clothes and items to the towns with larger Muslim communities is very expensive, while their value is not worth it. The brothers here ask your eminence if it is permissible to donate these items to non-Muslim societies; particularly the cancer society in the city, owing to the inability to give them to the needy Muslims. Please give us a fatwa. May Allah reward you.\nAll praise is due to Allah alone. Peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah. It is permissible to give these things to needful non-Muslims. In a hadith we read, “For giving any living creature, there is a reward” [Reported by al-Bukhary (2466) and Muslim (2244)] Thus, this reward is due for helping all the creatures of Almighty Allah. Almighty Allah says “Thus they feed with food – despite of their own desire for it – the indigent, the orphan and the captive of war.” [76:8] It is known that the prisoner of war in this verse refers to a non-Muslim. Nevertheless, Almighty Allah praised these persons for feeding the prisoner of war, even though he is a non-Muslim. Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy with him) said that Zakah could be given to non-Muslims – of course, he means those who live under a security pledge with the Muslims. Giving voluntary charity to the needy and the sick among the non-Muslims is rewardable, by the grace of Allah, and there is nothing that disallows it. In an authentic report we read that the mother of Asma’, daughter of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her), who was an unbeliever, came to her. Asma’ said to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), “My mother came to me full of hope. Shall I keep ties with her?” He said, “Yes, keep ties with here.” [Reported by a-Bukhary (2620) and Muslim (1003)] He ordered her to keep ties with her although she was a non-Muslim. Being a non-Muslim does not make giving charity to them forbidden; particularly to the needy and the sick. Accordingly, if they truly cannot deliver these things and cannot sell them to transfer their value in money to the needy persons  who deserve them, they may give them to these societies. This is something desirable and could help amend the relation between Muslims and others, manifest the tolerance and virtue of Islam, and show that Muslims aid all those in need, even if they are non-Muslims. Allah knows best.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Disagreement Is a Source of Mercy!!",
      "Answer": "\nPeace be upon you together with the mercy and blessings of Allah. There has been much talk among those who give Islamic lectures on whether the disagreement is a mercy for this ummah and whether scholars’ and jurists’ difference of opinions is a mercy for the nation of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). The question is: How can this be true while Islam always calls for unity and for the rejection of disagreements? Besides, natural disposition tells us that disagreements are not always praiseworthy or useful. What is the correct position concerning this issue in terms of the Shari`ah, the religion, any fatwas and the truth? May Allah guide us and you to the straight path and make us and you from among His righteous servants. All praise is due to the Lord of all the worlds.\nIn the name of Allah, the All-Merciful, the Mercy-giving. And upon you be peace and the mercy and blessings of Allah. This is a significant issue. The issue of disagreement among the ummah and it being a mercy is mentioned in an unauthentic hadith reported by al-Bayhaqy with a broken chain of narrators on the authority of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “Anything you have been given of the Book of Allah, you have to act on it. There is no excuse for any of you to neglect it. If there is no relevant ruling in the Book of Allah, then consider my unambiguous Sunnah. If there is no unambiguous Sunnah on my part, then consider what my companions have said. My companions are like stars in the sky, whichever one you follow you will be guided. Disagreement among my companions is a mercy for you.” Al-Albany cited this report in his al-Da`ifah (59) and called it spurious. Ibn al-Hajib also mentioned this report with a different wording that reads, “Disagreement among my ummah is a mercy.” Moreover, al-Mulla Ali al-Qaray said: Al-Suyuty said, “This was reported by Nasr al-Maqdisy in al-Hujjah, al-Bayhaqy in al-Risalah without a chain of narrators, al-Qady Husayn, Imam al-Haramayn, and others. Perhaps it was reported in some of the books of the scholars of hadith that have not reached us yet.” Al-Suytuy also reported on the authority of `Umar ibn `Abd al-`Azeez that he said, “I would not be pleased if the companions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) did not differ about any opinion; because if they did not differ, there would be no licensee.” Also al-Khateeb reported that Haron al-Rasheed said to Malik ibn Anas, “O Abu Abdullah! Let us write this book – i.e. al-Muwatta’ – and force people to adopt it and distribute it across the Islamic world to force people to adopt it.” He said, “O commander of the believer! Scholars’ difference of opinions is a mercy from Almighty Allah for this nation. Each one follows what has been proved authentic in his view, each of them is guided, and each of them has intended to please Almighty Allah.” Thus, these words indicate that the hadith that reads, “Disagreement among the ummah is a mercy” is not authentic, but there are indications that the issue has a basis, as in the words of `Umar ibn `Abd al-`Azeez and Malik (may Allah have mercy with him). This means that the commendable disagreement is that which is due to acceptable reasons, such as that due to different indications of words or the rationale of texts. Such a difference of opinion is called by Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy with him) the justifiable difference of opinion between the people of the truth. Thus, there is no harm in this kind of disagreement. Each Muslim should ponder on the wise advice written by one scholar to his son, saying, “Know the difference of opinions and you will become broadminded.” Hence, knowing the scholar’s difference of opinions and the reasons for these differences, which result from the different indications of words and the rationale of the texts, makes one know why ijtihad differs. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy with him) said, “If there is nothing in the Sunnah concerning the issue nor a consensus of opinion concerning it and ijtihad is justifiable, no blame should be directed to the one who acts according to this ijtiahd, whether he is a mujtahid or an imitator.” Al-`Izz ibn `Abd al-Salam said, “Whoever does something whose prohibition is controversial, believing in its lawfulness, should not be repudiated unless the opinion that makes it lawful is very weak.” Thus, difference of opinions in this case is considered as providing broad outlines for people concerning secondary issues. So whoever acts according to one of the scholars’ opinions in this case will be right, insha’Allah. Even if he is mistaken, he will be pardoned. He who practices ijtihad and reaches the correct ruling will have two rewards, and he who practices ijtihad and makes a mistake will have one reward, as mentioned in the hadith reported by al-Bukhary (7352) and Muslim (1716) on the authority of `Amr ibn al-`Ass (may Allah have mercy with him). In this case, any difference of opinion should not be rejected. This is the disagreement that represents mercy because it provides a broad outline for solving the issues and problems of the ummah and helps people to live with one another without having unjustifiable rancor or malice. As for the forbidden disagreement, it is the one mentioned in the Quranic verse, “ِِِAnd do not quarrel [among yourselves] or else you will become fainthearted and your strength depart.” [8:46] This disagreement leads to harboring hatred and turning back on one another. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) prohibited this and said, “Do not harbor rancor, turn your backs on one another or deceive one another in any sale, and be brothers, O servants of Allah!” [Reported by al-Bukhary (6066) and Muslim (2563) on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah have mercy wth him)] The disagreement that leads to harboring rancor and turning back on one another is the disagreement over major creedal issues, a matter that, according to the contemporary expression, goes beyond the red lines. It goes beyond the acceptable disagreement, resulting in disputes, fights, and disunity when facing the enemy. This disagreement is blameworthy. Hence, there is the commendable disagreement that is considered a healthy sign. This is the disagreement whose reasons are known and its good results for the ummah have become clear as it has provided easiness. And there is the blameworthy disagreement whose bad effects on the ummah have also become evident. Therefore, a scholar has to be insightful and be able to distinguish the kinds of disagreements that are tolerable and those kinds of disagreements that lead to destroying the unity of the ummah and lead to  rancor and turning one’s back on one another, which the Shari`ah has forbidden. I hope that the questioner has understood this. Almighty Allah knows best.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Difference in Moon-Sighting",
      "Answer": "\nWhat about the differences in moon-seeing which is nearly the same as the question of brother Khalyfah from Germany who started fasting according to Libya moon-seeing. What is your opinion in this regard, sheikh?\n In the name of Allah, the All-Merciful, the Mercy-giving. There is a difference of opinion whether it is obligatory to fast Ramadan upon seeing the moon anywhere in the world or each country should observe its own moon-seeing as in hadith of Kuryb. This is a kind of agreeable difference of opinion. Moreover, as the times of Prayers differ from one country to the other, there should be no problem over the different times of fasting. The crescent may appear to one country and disappear to the other if it sets before sunset. When the crescent sets before sunset, it is considered unborn at that time. But if all Muslims fast at the same moon-seeing, which is the position of the majority, there will be no problem. What is important is that we have to depend on seeing it. In the Sunnah we read “Observer fasting when you see it [i.e. the new moon] and break your fast when you see it [again]” and “Do not observe fasting until you see the crescent.” This is a strong assertion from the lawgiver. Thus it must be seen actually. Those who depend on astronomical calculations have to depend on such calculations that prove the ability to see the crescent. However, if the calculations say that it will be there but it cannot be seen by naked eye, this cannot be relied on. Thus we rely on such calculations in negation not in affirmation because when the crescent is in a state of conjunction, which I call the period of sinking down, it is unborn though it has come to existence. Therefore, we say that people have to see it.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Difference of Qur’an Commentators on Qur’an",
      "Answer": "\nPeace and blessings be upon you. My question is about a doubt raised about the Quran that was contrived by Christians and spread among the people. I hope you give an answer concerning it before an overwhelming mischief takes place. This doubt goes as follow: Almighty Allah said, “If it had been from other than Allah, they would, most surely, have found in it much discrepancy.” It is known among the Muslims that there are differences of opinion concerning many of the verses of the Quran, which constitutes evidence, according to those who propagate this doubt, that the Quran is from other than Almighty Allah. How can we respond to this?\n All praise is due to Allah. Peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and his companions. And upon you be peace, together with the mercy and blessings of Allah. In the first place, this verse should be understood in a different way than the one adopted by such doubt-mongers. The issue has no relation with scholars’ difference of opinions concerning the indications of the verses of the Quran.  It rather could be interpreted in either of three ways: first, discrepancy here stands for contradiction; for the Quran contains no contradiction. It enjoins absolute justice and excellence, and thus it includes no unfairness or injustice. Hence, the basic and major principles to which the Quran calls never differ, while if it were from other than Allah, whims would overcome man and he would enjoin good one time and evil another time. This is the first interpretation. Second, had the Quran been from other than Allah, it would have differed from actual reality; that is, the information it gives would have differed from the reality of the matter it talks about. However, the Quran never has mentioned anything but it turned out to be so. It speaks to them about the disbelief and hypocrisy they harbor, and they know this for sure. They know that what the Quran warns them against is true. All that the Quran talks about is true, be it related to the conditions of the universe or to the actions of the people. Realities, experiences and the present always prove the truthfulness of the noble Quran. This has clearly manifested itself in the scientific miracles of the Quran and the Sunnah. Third, had it been from other than Allah, you would have found it different from what it is. Since it is not different from what it is, we know that it is from Allah. This needs some reflection and subtle understanding. The meaning is that had this Book been from other than Allah, it would have been different from this noble Quran, as the Quran, like its Composer, is noble and excellent. These are the three interpretations given by the exegetes to this verse, “If it had been from other than Allah, they would, most surely, have found in it much discrepancy.” [4:82] However, it is from Allah and thus there is no discrepancy in it. The issue, thus, has nothing to do with scholars’ difference of opinions over the verses of the Quran, the different indications of its words, or the different lengths of its chapters. All this is not intended by the noble verse. This is the answer to doubt raised about this verse. Allah knows best.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Did Imam Ali Burn the Kharijites?",
      "Answer": "\nI read on a website that Ali ibn Abu Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) burnt some of the Kharitjites during his caliphate. But this made me confused due to the hadith we know where the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) forbad torturing others with fire since this is a sort of associating others with Allah. So how did Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) do this?\nAnd upon you is the peace of Allah, together with his mercy and blessings. This report was narrated by al-Bukhary (6922) on the authority of `Ikrimah who said: Heretics were brought before Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) and he burnt them. When Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) was informed about this, he said, “If I were in his place, I would not have burnt them for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) forbad this saying, “Do not torment with the torment of Allah” and I would have killed them, for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “Whoever changes his religion, kill him.”” When a deviant group called al-Saba’iyyah, who were the followers of the Jewish `Abdullah ibn Saba’, went astray and believed that Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) was a god – we seek refuge with Allah from this – he (Ali) set them on fire and said, “When I saw such an enormous evil, I set them on fire and called.” Besides, this issue is a particular case that has no general application, as al-Shatiby said. In general, there are many interpretations concerning this report, whether he burnt them after he had killed them, or he was just about to burn them but he did not. Whatever the case was, this was an opinion viewed by a companion that has nothing to do with associating gods with Allah. Burning a person is not permissible in the Shari`ah; but this does not amount to associating others with Allah. Associating others with Allah means to worship another god with Allah or to believe in other gods with Almighty Allah. Yes, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) forbad burning others and said “None should torment with fire except Allah.” [Reported by al-Bukhary (3016)] Yet, this does not mean that whoever burns others with fire is considered as associating others with Allah. It rather means that this punishment is a punishment in the Hereafter, not in this world. This is what we should believe. The issue has no relation to associating others with Allah. As mentioned above, this interpretation may prove untrue. Perhaps he intended to burn them but he did not or he intended to burn them after killing them. Even if he actually burnt them, this would be a kind of ijtihad from a companion that disagrees with the text. The ultimate reference is always to the text. Nonetheless, we have to believe that they acted according to their ijtihad and that they are illuminating guides.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

In Maraqi As-Su`ud (Stairs of Happiness), it is stated,\nHis innate deeds such as eating\nAnd drinking are not acts of worship\nThe acts done by the Prophet as a human being are not actually legislated by Shari`ah, but it remains desirable to imitate his way of doing them.

The dialogue conducted between the Muslim and Jewish communities  across Europe and USA is natural, especially if they are citizens of the same state. For the sake of coexistence, citizenship and a common interest in stabilizing their country through peace, they resort to dialogue amongst themselves. Moreover, if the Muslim communities avoid such a dialogue, this may cause them trouble.”\nBin Bayyah added: “It is natural for Muslims to respond to dialogue if they are invited to do so. This is something positive and is required. Additionally, we should not impose any tutelage on Muslim minorities in the West. They are responsible for their own actions, they understand the importance of dialogues that are in their best interests and can distinguish those dialogues held for false and malicious propaganda. This approach is for the dialogue between Muslim minorities and the Jews of the West.\n“As for the dialogue between Muslims and Jews in the Arab world, this is a more controversial matter. It depends upon the discretion of countries and how the Jews in question deal with the Palestinian cause. These countries must take into account the policy of opening dialogue channels with the Jewish community. For instance, there are Arab countries that have opened channels of dialogue and established diplomatic relations with Israel, while other countries still refuse to open any such dialogue with Jews. There are many attempts by Jewish organizations to open bridges of dialogue with the Islamic countries. I was invited to one of these dialogues held by a French Jewish organization calling itself ‘Hommes de Parole’ (“Men of Words”) in Morocco. It appeared to me, however, that I had nothing to discuss with them, so I apologized and did not attend.”\nBin Bayyah went on to say: “The issue of dialogue in my opinion is dependent on the discretion of the higher authorities of scholars and rulers in the Arab and Muslim countries. It should be noted that dialogue in itself is not a problem; but dialogue with Jews needs to be considered carefully so that Muslims may not fall in the trap of cheap propaganda. Such dialogue neither helps nor has any benefit to Muslims, whether the parties that call for dialogue are private international or governmental Jewish organizations.”\nSheikh Bin Bayyah concluded by saying: “The Muslims have to distinguish between dialogue with the Jews transgressing on our land and holy places, and the Jews opposing this occupation. That is, there is a small group of Jews in the world who have a humanistic approach. This group stands strongly against the Israeli occupation and the Zionist project in the region. Hence, there is no harm in opening a channel of constructive dialogue with them to the interest of the Muslims.\n“The same applies to the dialogue between Muslim minorities in the West and the Jews of their countries. However, opening a direct channel of dialogue with the transgressing Jews on our land is dependent on a number of factors. Namely, the discretion of the rulers and scholars in Muslim countries, and the aspects of interest for Islam, Muslims and the Palestinian cause, away from all personal interests.”\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Despair Not of God’s Grace",
      "Answer": "\nIn the Name of God, the Merciful and beneficent. Praise be to the possessor of the heavens and the earth, the Living, the Sustaining, the Omnipotent, the Overpowering, the Merciful, and the Gracious. With these Names and Attributes. He revolves day and night, encompassing everything with his Knowledge and Mercy. Benedictions and solace be upon our master Muhammad, the prophet and final messenger of God, and upon his brothers, among the many prophets and messengers before him. My friends and brothers, I greet you and express heartfelt gratitude for your generous invitation during this particular time of pain and sadness we all share for those innocent people of varying faiths that were killed by an evil hand in New York and Washington. We particularly appreciate and highly value the position that the highest Church authorities have taken during this crisis concerning attempts to use this tragedy as a Trojan Horse in order to attack the civilization of Islam and to condemn Islam and Muslims, forgetting history as well as the rights of ancient neighbors from both the Christian and Muslim civilizations.\nWe all share in our condemnation of the heinous act of terror that no sacred tradition sanctions, especially the religion of Islam. Reason itself rejects this act of madness. It is nihilistic to kill oneself and to kill others unjustly; thus, two grave wrongs were perpetrated on that day according to Islam. While there are still ambiguous aspects to this affair, and the realities of what took place have not all been made apparent, we make it clear to you, in no uncertain terms, that if the accusations are in anyway true, then the Muslim jurists are the first to demand the most severe punishments for these acts.\nThe Islamic faith considers the murder of one soul on a par with killing all of humanity: the Quran states,\n“Whoever kills one soul unjustly, it is as if he has killed all of humanity” (Maidah:32). This is because a solitary soul represents all of humanity in the beginning of creation and in its re-creation as God says, “Your creation and your resurrection is as one soul” (Luqman: 28). Furthermore, the sacred law of Islam prohibits killing animals and cutting down trees without right. Our Prophet, peace be upon him, mentioned a specific person who was punished in hell for torturing a cat by locking it up and starving it to death. The Prophet, peace be upon him, prohibited killing ants, bees, and frogs. Tell me, how then could he permit the killing of a human being, whom God has ennobled and dignified over the rest of His creation? “And verily, We have given the children of Adam their human dignity. We have carried them safely over land and sea and provided them from the good things of the Earth” (Quran, Isra:70 ) Islam is a message that enjoins spreading peace toward those one knows and those one does not know as mentioned in the prophetic tradition. We are here to extend to you goodness, virtue, and love based upon our own Quran’s injunction: “God has not prohibited you from displaying all forms of goodness and equity toward those who do not persecute you or drive you from your legitimate homes: (Mumtahinah: 8). The conditions set down here are not biased or unfair. The first related to the freedom of religion and the second, the right to live in security in a person’s own land. There is an interesting point this verse highlights, and that is the idea of treating all human beings with equity. Qadi Abu Bakr, a scholar from Spain from the 12th Century, explains that equity in this verse means “sharing with equitable non-Muslims a portion of one’s wealth as a response to their good character and treatment of the Muslim”.\nIn the Quran, God says, “You will find the closest to the believing Muslims in love are those who call themselves Christians. That is because from among them are priests and monks, and they do not behave haughtily”(Maidah: 82). These are beautiful qualities that God has described the true Christians as possessing. The Quran says, “God commands you to act justly”(Nahal: 90). Our relationship with you is one of peace, virtue, and justice. That is the position of Islam yesterday, today, and tomorrow. It is a principled position that has no relationship to the shifting balances of power.\nThere is no denying that we bear the burdens of a shared history of past troubles and the weight of today’s problems, and if God does not receive us with His Grace, we fear greatly the dark possibilities of our future. Moreover, there are biased interpretations and views that some groups adopt in every faith and religion which may reach extremes. It is, nonetheless, possible for us to invoke the relevant injunctions from our sacred scriptures that are the closest to a global spirit of cooperation and peace within the frame of a culture of peace.\nOur friends on the other side of the Mediterranean must also help us with one concept only, and that is justice. Justice is a precious word to each of our faiths as well as the rest of humanity in every time and place. According to our faith, one of the Names among the Names of God is The Just. We have a sacred tradition in which God speaks to all of His creation saying,\n“O My servants, I have prohibited for Myself oppression, and I have prohibited it for you also, so do not oppress one another”. We know that Infinite Justice is God’s alone. Therefore, we have to analyze three key understandings: my justice, your justice, and Absolute justice. We need to discuss and come to an understanding of the concepts that are shared and absolute between all of the revealed religions using the tools we have been given, including our intellects and human reason. Indeed, As Aristotle says, “The intellect is the most equitably divided trait among humans”. The explanation of justice that is most shared among us is simply this: an innocent person should not be taken to account for the wrongs of a guilty person. This is a universal principle that none of us can debate. Indeed, it is an Abrahamic principle according to the Quran: “Have they not been informed of what was in the Scrolls of Moses and Abraham who fulfilled their covenants-that one soul does not bear the wrongs of another and that a human being has only what he strives for?” Another principle we all share is that a man is innocent until he is proven guilty. We Muslims call this principle original innocence because we regard a human being as basically good unless he proves himself otherwise through vile actions as the Quran states, “This is the inherent nature that God created humanity upon”(Rum:30). The Quran also warns us: “Verily any accusations so that you are not oppressive toward a people out of ignorance, and then have remorse for the harm you caused”(Hujurat: 6). We must also work together to redress the historical wrongs of the past and of the present by attempting to find the shared understanding that most approximates the ideal of Absolute Justice. For if we do that, we can indeed overcome these trials and deracinate terrorism, religiously inspired acts of insanity, and reactionary extremism within our midst. We must expend our energies and enlist our scholars and sages in coming to a just solution to the question of Palestine so as to prevent the matter from being left to people who have lost their sense of balance or who actually desire wars and conflicts. Indeed, peace is not only the best of what is good for the weak but for the strong as well. In addition, we must not allow special interest groups that benefit from wars and their consequences to declare a war of civilizations, especially between Islam and Christianity.\nWe prefer peace and conviviality to vying for civilizational superiority. We must also make serious efforts to come to a precise definition of the concepts and technical terms we use, such as terrorism. Unfortunately, a war over terminology can lead to physical violence and actual warfare. Frankly, many Muslims ask, “What do the super-powers mean by terrorism?”. They want to know on what exactly is war being waged before they board the ship setting sail to wage war on it. In fact, they are afraid that if they get on the ship, the captain might suddenly, in mid-sea, turn and accuse them of being terrorists! Is terrorism killing innocents, destroying property, and threatening people’s security? Or, is wearing a turban, building Quranic schools, reciting the Quran, and teaching people Islam considered terrorism? Is legitimate defense of your homeland and the attempt to rightfully take back what was wrongfully taken from you considered terrorism by he who has wronged you?\nThese questions need to be answered and should be before any of us gets on board with the captain of the ship. We should also proclaim this century a century of peace, development, religious tolerance, and culture in order that humanity may enjoy the gifts an blessings of this earth which we share in the shade of our Creator’s dominion until humanity receives our master Jesus, peace be upon him. We wish to be living in peace and prosperity as he descends from his heavenly abode in that wondrous and exalted state that was described by our Prophet, upon him be peace, when he said about Jesus, He will descend from on high upon the white minaret to the east of Damascus with his hands on the wings of two angels. If he lowers or raises his head, beads like pearls fall from him. Any disbeliever who receives a whiff of his breath’s scent will die, and his scent reaches to where his eye leaves off. The Antichrist seeks him out and Christ kills him at the gate of Ludd. He then wipes the brows of some of those whom the Antichrist had no effect upon, and he informs them of their ranks in Paradise. He then isolates himself with the believers until Gog and Magog are removed. God then Blesses the earth, and it is said to the earth, “O earth, bring forth your provisions and fruits, and give again your blessings.” In those days, many will eat from one pomegranate and rest in the shade of its shell (related by Muslim, part 18). Another narration states, “During Jesus’ reign, such security will exists that a camel will graze with the lion and the beast of prey with cows and sheep. Children will play with snakes, and none harm the other”(Musnad, 406:2). Thus, peace is described in those days. So let us ask ourselves this: Do we want to greet such days in the shade of wars and conflict or peace and love?\nFinally, perhaps we should listen well and heed the advice of Prophet Jacob, peace be upon him, when he said to his sons, “O my sons, go seek out Joseph, and do not despair of God’s Grace. For none but people without gratitude despair of the Grace of God.” Let us then never despair of the Mercy of our Lord.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Dialogue or Clash of Civilizations?",
      "Answer": "\nThe ruler of Algeria once slapped the French Consul on his face. The result was that France occupied Algeria for 130 years and did not leave except with millions of victims. A heinous act was committed in America and Muslims denounced it, even though it was alleged that its perpetrators were Muslims. Nevertheless, the western media insists on accusing Muslims and Islam of violence and terrorism. The French proverb seems to ring true: ‘He who wants to kill his dog can just accuse it of having rabies.’\nToday, the confrontation has intellectual, cultural and ethical dimension presented in the form of the theory of the clash of civilizations, which rests on the opinions of Bernard Louis, a Jewish orientalist. He said for example: “The clash of civilizations is a trend and movement that goes beyond many levels of political issues and the governments that produce them. It is no less than a clash of civilization, perhaps an irrational one. But it is undoubtedly a reaction of an old enemy to our Jewish secular heritage, our secular present, and the international expansion of both.”\nObviously, there is no eternal war between human beings just as there is no eternal peace between them – even between the people of the same culture. Thus, dialogue has become a sacred duty in these circumstances to save ourselves, to save the West from itself and to save us all from the misunderstanding and malice that fill the hearts of some. When a group of Muslims acts in aggression, they are at once branded as terrorists. But when blood is shed in Palestine, it is simply a mistake in time and place. Dialogue should deal with this de facto injustice and with the orders given to different authorities over the Islamic world concerning curriculums, women’s and human rights. Such orders make us feel insulted.\nThe dialogue to which we call can take place through a cultural alliance between Muslim intellectuals and western intellectuals who express their opinions rationally and objectively in their countries. We have to discover the horizons for a long term dialogue. I would prefer that the money dedicated to teaching democracy or promoting women, be redirected to finance a project for mutual understanding and dialogue. Such a project would need to look for common ground in order to use this as a basis for a relationship of mutual respect.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Delivering the Second Friday Khutbah in Arabic",
      "Answer": "\nDear Sheikh! I am a Mauritanian Muslim living in the capital of Angola where there is only one mosque. After finishing the first Khutbah of Jumu`ah Prayer, the Imam gives the second Khutbah, which is a translation of the first one in Portuguese, the country’s official language. So no Arabic word is said during the second Khutbah, except any Ayah or Hadith. My question is: Is it permissible to pray behind an Imam who does not say the second Khutbah in Arabic?\nThe basic ruling is that both Khutbahs should be given in Arabic and this is the opinion of the majority of scholars. On the other hand, Abu Hanifah (may Allah be merciful to him) declared it permissible to give the Khutbah in another language. Thus, there is no problem in praying behind this Imam, especially if the people do not understand Arabic well. Yet, we advise the Imam to repeat some Arabic sentences in the second Khutbah, such as “Udhkuru Allah Yadhkurkum (remember Allah and He will remember you)” and “Istaghfiru Allah Al-`Azhim Innahu kan Ghaffara (Seek forgiveness from Allah, for He is All-Forgiving)” and the like. These sentences will remove any doubt in the whole matter. We ask Allah to grant us all success!\n\n Original Source Link \n",

Peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah. Brother, you have to give priority to the obligation of hajj because it is an immediate obligation, according to the position of the majority of scholars. So, as long as you have enough money to fulfill the obligation of hajj and will not leave your family in hardship, you have to go to perform hajj and not defer it. Hajj is an immediate obligation, according to the position of Malik, Ahmad and a strong opinion in the Hanifite school.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

Does the ruling differ if one of the parties or both of them are non-Muslims? Give us your Fatwa, may Allah reward you!\nThe prohibition to conduct sales after the Adhan is restricted to the Jumu`ah prayer, for Allah says: “O you who believe (Muslims)! When the call is proclaimed for the Salat (prayer) on the day of Friday (Jumu’ah prayer), come to the remembrance of Allah [Jumu’ah religious talk (Khutbah) and Salat (prayer)] and leave off business (and every other thing)…” (Al-Jumu`ah, 62:9) This order to leave off business is particular to Jumu`ah prayer, while it is permissible to conduct business after the Adhan of any other prayer. On the other hand, if this business distracts a Muslim from prayer, any distraction is not permissible. In any case, the contract is valid and it does not matter if one of the parties or both are non-Muslims.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Answer": "\nIn his answer to al-Sharq al-Awsat Newspaper’s question about the permissibility of criticizing a religious group in a comedic way as in Arabic drama, his eminence sheikh Abdullah ibn Bayyah, member of the Fiqh Academy in Mecca, said:\nBasically, it is definitely prohibited to criticize, mock at, or deride of the right religion and whoever does this bears enormous sin. But if this is about irreligious or improper practices or about things attributed to the religion while they are not of it, this apparently seems permissible.\nThe sheikh added that criticizing the commissions that enjoin good and forbid evil, which are not infallible, is not permissible except in a respectable manner and after verifying the credibility of some issues to shun sinful accusations and defamation. He pointed out that criticism should be only for rectification not for spreading chaos in society. He considered resorting to sardonic comedy in criticizing practices attributed to the religion as something that Muslim communities are not familiar with. This thus could lead to evil when criticism turns to be impugnment.\nDr. Ibn Bayyah likened criticism in some cases to walking on thorns. It may also give the impression of being part of an international program that aims at distorting Islam and some of its institutions. This could stir and fuel troubles.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Answer": "\nIt is recommended to recite al-Fåti˙ah unrestrictedly; meaning, without confining it to a specific place\nor occasion. Allah, Transcendent and Exalted is He, says: Recite from the Qur’an as much as is easy\nfor you.2 And in the very same verse: So recite from it as much as is easy. Hence reciting the Qur’an\nentails a tremendous reward. Allah, Transcendent is He, will grant to you in return ten good deeds for\neach letter [of the Qur’an] you recite. I do not say that Alif. Låm. M•m. is a letter. Rather, Alif is a letter;\nLåm is a letter; and M•m is a letter. Its like was said by the Prophet, peace be upon him, as reported\nby al-Tirmidh•, no.2910; by way of Ibn Mas‘¥d, may Allah be pleased with him.\nAl-Tirmidh• also records, no.2926; by way of Abu Sa‘•d al-Khudr•, may Allah be pleased with him; the\nhadith: “Whoever, because of being preoccupied with the Qur’an or with remembrance of Me, asks\nnot of Me, I shall grant him the best of what I give to those who ask [of Me].” This is because [reciting]\nthe Qur’an is one of the most meritorious and highly recommended of deeds.\nAs for doing so at the start of any gathering, or at its conclusion, then there is no explicit text related\nabout this. If someone does so believing that it is a Sunnah, or an obligation, then this contravenes the\nSacred Law. But if he recites it in order to seek blessings (tabarruk) with the Noble Qur’an, then, Allah\nwilling, there is nothing wrong with this according to the view we hold to be the soundest. The issue\nentails a dispute related to what is called bid‘ah i∂åfiyyah – “innovation by way of extension”.3 Many\nMålik• scholars detest this type of bid‘ah, whereas in the opinion of other scholars the issue goes back\nto the nature of al-dal•l al-‘åmm – general proofs, and what their scope encompasses of [unrestricted]\nallowance or recommendation. This latter rule is the view of the Shafi‘•s and al-‘Izz b. ‘Abd al-Salåm,\nas well as of al-Qaråf• who was a Målik•.\nTherefore the issue, Allah willing, is one in which there is no problem, in the sense that it should not\nbe a cause for schisms to arise between Muslims: “Do not hate one another, do not envy one another,\ndo not turn your backs on one another,” says one hadith recorded by al-Bukhår•, no.6065 and Muslim,\nno.2599; by way of Anas, may Allah be pleased with him.\nThus, whoever wishes to recite [al-Fåti˙ah at the start or end of a meeting], we should not prevent them\nfrom doing so. However, one should not think that this is a Sunnah, or that the Prophet, upon whom\nbe peace, began in such a manner. This would not be correct.

      "Question": "Common Values",
      "Answer": "\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of worlds. Peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah and upon his family and Companions.\nWe would like to show our grateful acknowledgement to the institutions that invited us to share our views on ‘common values’ that hope to become a basis of understanding, mutual approach and harmony. Surely, this is promising if we look for the common fundamentals and spheres of agreement to manifest their hidden meanings and develop their incentives. This is the reason behind my personal research on this subject.\nThe research at hand is not expected to be a conclusive philosophic thesis. I will briefly discuss, after defining the word ‘values’, the issue of the existence of common values in light of philosophy, the texts of Shari`ah (“Islamic Law”) and the comments of scholars.\nThe definition of Qiyam (“values”)\nFirstly, let us demonstrate the definition of ‘values’. If we reviewed the corresponding synonyms of the word values in French we will find ‘ethique‘ which indicates a set of rules of conduct. We also find the term ‘valeurs‘, which refers to matters qualified as being right, beautiful and good, in accordance with personal or societal criteria, and can be used as a criterion and reference of a moral principle.\nAs for the meaning of the word in Arabic, it is the plural of Qima (“value”) which refers to what makes something valuable or useful. An Arabic maxim says: “The value of a person is what they are excelled in.” The word value means a praiseworthy and noble character which prompts man to acquire it, just as precious things. Also, it refers to the price of a value.\nThe word Qiyam may be mentioned to refer to a singular infinitive as in the Qur’an: “Truly, my Lord has guided me to ‘Din-an Qiyam-an’ (a Straight Path, a right religion)” (Al-An`am 6:161) in one of the recitations of the Qur’an. Also, it is mentioned in Allah’s Words: “And give not unto the foolish your property which Allah has made ‘Qiyam-an’ (a means of support for you)” (Al-Nisaa 4:5) in the recitation of Nafi` referring to the means of support. If something is Qayyim, it has a precious value. Another recitation of the aforementioned verse says, “Din-an Qiyam-an” with the meaning of a straight religion or a religion sufficient for the interests of people and considers them.\nPhilosophers defined value as ‘man’s ruling on something which gives rise to objection and protest against existence with its current reality to change it to what should be.’ Depending on this linguistic meaning, the word ‘values’ stands for moral principles that are praised and commended while their opposites are denounced and condemned. Here, we should mention briefly the definition of ‘morals’, which stands for both the inherent characters in the soul and the outward manifestation of these characters. Some scholars view morals as psychological rather than external, as the outer appearance is conduct or treatment.(i)\nAccordingly, a value is only what is approved, provided that such approval is general and continual. If someone loves a kind of food, this cannot be a value. Also, this general approval may be confined to certain society or may extend to the whole humanity. It is known that philosophers are not in agreement regarding the existence of common values.\nThe values belonging to certain societies that stem from conventions or religion are an undisputable fact. However, the existence of common values is questionable for philosophers. According to scholars of Usul-ul-Fiqh (“Principles of Religion”), we should verify the point of disagreement. Let us therefore pose the following questions: What is the core of ‘value’? Being the basis of all values, does goodness have an objective, absolute existence? Is there such a thing as goodness within the general meaning of the word or is it always subjective, pursuant to approval of certain persons or groups?\nPhilosophers disagree over this basic issue to such an extent that several approaches have emerged. These approaches have divided into the economists, socialists, opportunists and idealists. To summarize, there are two main stances: those who advocate relativity, maintaining that the existence of a common value is untrue, regardless of the title used; and those who state that values are common, regardless of the motives. After dealing with these two schools of thought, I will point out the position of Islam in this regard and conclude with a linguistic article.\nTheories of relativity and absolute principle\nThe best expression about relativity and the dependence of values on community is clarified by Whitehead in his book Adventures of Ideas. Whitehead states: “The details of these moral criteria are related to the social conditions of the environment corresponding to life in a particular time, such as the life in the fertile part of Arabian Peninsula, the life on lower slopes of Himalaya, the life in the plains of China and India or the life in a delta. However, the meaning of these criteria is changeable and obscure, such as the concepts of monarchy, family, marriage, reason and Almighty God.\n“For example, the behavior which brings about an appropriate criterion of agreeable satisfaction in a certain environment and stage may be in another environment and stage ignoble to the highest degree. Therefore, each society has its special pattern of perfection which bears specific inevitable difficulties in its stage. Thus, the claim that there are specific regulative concepts which are well-adjusted to clarify the details of behavior of all sensible beings on the earth, in any other planet and in each solar system, is a concept worthy of negligence because it is a single pattern of perfection applied to the whole universe.”(ii) This is the doctrine of relativity.\nOn the other side we have the ‘absolute doctrine’ as explained by Hunter Mead who says: “In short, the absolute doctrine can be better illustrated by the fact that there is only one criterion or one law with regard to ethics that is right, since antiquity. This criterion or law is applicable to all people and is separated from time, geographic location, social customs, legal convention and anything else. Something that represents commitment in my country is equally the same in China, Spain or Poland.\n“Moreover, it was a form of commitment for the Greeks and Europeans in middle centuries, whether they were aware of that or not. Also, it will be a commitment for all future races and civilizations. Whatever is good nowadays was the same in the past and will be so forever. There is no moral law for the past and another for the present or a criterion for the East and another for the West. Yet, goodness and right are comprehensive and applicable to every time and place.”(iii)\nHowever, the theory of absolute principle is supported by divine religions, especially those that call to comprehensiveness. Hunter Mead admits that the source of the western civilization is Christianity. He elaborates: “When we mention a Christian, we mean in philosophy the ‘monotheistic’. This is because the belief in one God rules the universe which He created. This is the basis of religious western thought…These orders of Allah are comprehensive and applicable to all people everywhere.”\nThe logical source\nIt could be said that Kant was the most renowned rationalist in the field of ethics. He believed that analysis is always able to establish that violating the moral law represents violation of the law of logic. Actually, immorality contains contradiction. Let us quote the most famous examples which Kant gave in this respect: “When we make a promise with no intention to fulfill it, our behavior becomes a kind of evil, because we base our behavior on two contradictory principles in the same time. One of these two principles is that people should believe in promise but one violates it. This means that every person has the right to violate his promise as long as the moral law is comprehensive. Then, if everyone breaks his promise, no one will believe in the promise and we will have another principle that it is right that no one should believe in promises. Surely, this principle contradicts the first one.”(iv)\nIn regards to Muslims, all our intellectual conceptions refer to a common basis for values between humans, in accordance with the following principles:\n1. Islam admits the principle of absolute equality between people and refers them to one source because their Lord is One and their father is one. Almighty Allah says: “O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another.” (Al-Hujurat 49:13) The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “O people, your Lord is One and your father is one. You all are Adam’s offspring, and Adam was created from soil. Verily, the most honorable of you with Allah is that who has piety. An Arab is not superior to a non-Arab, a non-Arab is not superior to an Arab or a white person is not superior to a red person except through piety.”(v)\nTherefore, I support the view that there are common values and that globalization and its means (including means of transportation and communication) have removed the material barrier that Whitehead spoke of, though the psychological barrier is still present.\n2. The Message of the seal of the Prophets, Muhammad (peace be upon him), is for all people. Allah (exalted be He) says: “Say, (O Muhammad), “O mankind, verily I am sent to you as the Messenger of Allah-to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. None has the right to be worshipped but He; it is He Who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write, who believes in Allah and His words…and follow Him that you may be guided“.” (Al-A`raf 7:158)\n3. Islam maintains that an inclination to good, faith and right is the natural disposition of all people. Allah says: “So set your face towards the religion of pure Islamic monotheism, (Allah’s Fitrah) with which He has created mankind. No change let there be in  Khalqillah (the religion of Allah), that is the straight religion, but most of men know not.” (Al-Rum 30:30)\nNo matter how far the intellectual disputes over the absolute and proportional principle go and how the philosophic theories twist endlessly, it is obvious that there are common values among people. Reason (the best thing divided among people, according to René Descartes) and language are the best evidences for that.\nNoble characteristics\nAll minds and languages consider ‘justice’ a noble and beloved word. It is commonly accepted that ‘truthfulness’, ‘freedom’, ‘tolerance’, ‘faithfulness’ and the like are praiseworthy words for all people. Mankind also deems the opposite of such words as dispraised and unacceptable, for example ‘injustice’ or ‘oppression’. If you say to the most wrongful person that he is unjust he will become annoyed, even if he is described fairly. The same is true for ‘lying’, ‘fanaticism’ and ‘betrayal’ that are reprehensible words and detested by all people. Likewise, nature and reason deny them. Is this not a practical evidence and clear proof on the existence of common values?\nPeople should always respect human rights, as arguably this is a bare minimum quality without which humanity cannot survive. But, employment of noble characteristics, such as leniency, mercy, altruism, cooperation and helping the needy or disabled regardless of their race, religion or geographic origin, provides a new concept for humanity. This concept surpasses the neutral principle of human rights, such as equality and blindness to difference, to positivity in treatment which gives the other a sense of love and brotherhood.\nThis notion conforms with the Arabic saying: “Treat people as you would like them to treat you.” There is a hadith which refers to such deeper meanings which states: “None of you believes until they love for his brother what they love for themselves.” This hadith confirms the value of love and the value of human brotherhood which gives a sense of kinship. In fact, this explanation is not my own as, many centuries ago, scholars such as Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbali in his explanation of Al-Arba`in Al-Nawawiyyah (“The Forty Hadith compiled by Al-Nawawi”) and Al-Shabrakhiti said, “The brotherhood mentioned in the hadith is the human brotherhood.”\nLove is a graceful value, as every human being yearns to be loved. It is rare that you come across a person who enjoys being hated by others. Such behavior is a paradox, where some people quarrel with others on the plea that the latter do not love them. However, they mistake the means to people’s hearts, as maintained by the Mauritanian scholar. When love is felt by both sides, no aggression emerges. Love is constituted of sentiment, behavior, incarnation, and declaration. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “When one of you loves another, let he inform him of that.” So, it is a value because all people have a high opinion of it, even those who do not share it. Such is the criterion of value. Everybody seeks to acquire it because everyone wishes to be just and tolerant.\nHowever, these values may dry up if they are not fostered and developed by education. An Arabic poet once said: “If nurtured by noble deeds…good manners grow like a plant.” As a matter of fact, the most important value that symbolizes the solution of the world’s problems is the respect of disagreement, or even love of disagreement, so that it is regarded as a source of cultural richness, a sort of gracefulness and a basis for human character. If we think highly of disagreement and develop the law of virtue in addition to the law of human rights, we can put the basis of employing the common values that turn difference into harmony and change enmity to love. In accordance with Allah’s saying: “The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better; then verily! He, between you and whom there was enmity (will become) as though he was a close friend.” (Fussilat 41:34) It is a moral law confirmed by the Qur’an, namely tolerance, that gives birth to love.\nApplication of values in modern society\nWe hope that the common forms of goodness and the human munificent common values will be developed. This can be realized through our virtuous manners, tolerance, generosity, truthfulness, faithfulness and honesty. These values will, in turn, convince others to show us the same noble treatment because they, being human, share the same satisfaction with these values. Goodness leads to goodness and similarly generosity. Moreover, convincing others with good treatment is the most important human concern. We quote the saying of Plato:\n“The spread of morals in the world is an indication of the triumph of persuasion over power. The value of people is expressed in their willingness for persuasion. They are eligible for conviction on all sides where it is possible to replace power with persuasion, as one of them is the best and the other is the worst. Yet, civilization is to maintain the social system through natural convincing expressed in choosing the best. No matter how inevitable it is, the use of power reveals the failure of civilization whether for the community in general or for individuals.”\nTherefore, this sort of harmony should not be limited to societies with different cultures, but in fact this kind of accord is needed in the life of each person who embodies different cultures. For example, a person may have an Asian origin, Muslim religion and British birth and upbringing. Sometimes this creates a sort of struggle of values inside them but this should change to harmony and cultural richness. We studied something of that in the biographies of late scholars and it was a source of richness, rather than contradiction. So, let us try to achieve such harmony within ourselves in order to have our hope founded on a firm basis; otherwise it is not hope, simply deception. It is unacceptable that one does nothing for love and expects to realize it. Abu Hamid al-Ghazali said: “This is like someone who waits for harvest without sowing or wants children without marriage.”\nAnother problem is the great inconformity between words and deeds, or ‘hypocrisy’ as indicated by Al-Tughra’y. There is a great difference between the actions of politicians and values. Indeed, if this inconformity decreased, it would be possible to evade many of the foolish sacrifices that society has to make. We should pay greater attention to the value of tolerance in place of hatred or violence and direct the powers of youth to channels of innovation and general interest, instead of forcing them on wars in armies or volunteering to die in suicidal groups. We should provide alternatives to reach interests without engaging in wars.\nThe awakening of international conscience is necessary in order to rewrite the law of virtues, to remind people of their human rights and that they are legal privileges for every human being. However, when we hear of the struggle between Democrats and Republicans in the country of the world’s greatest power, one realizes that this hopeful awakening is out of reach. This is because the dispute is around the means and not the aims or the principles. This is a very uncomfortable reality, as the world has waited for a long time, but still no change has materialized.\nSuch disagreement is about the greatest basic values, such as the right to life, honor and freedom. We hope it is in fact about the finer details of those who deserve life and those who deserve freedom. Surely respecting disagreement, establishing its importance and building the bridges of unity is the sole path to restoring the values of man, because all of us deserve these values.\nConclusion\nScholars of religion should be a part of the solution and not a part of the problem. We have witnessed in the past some scholars who have only agitated disagreement by trying to please others, but such actions have reflected negatively on the values of human cooperation and good understanding. Media, institutions of civil society, universities and research centers are also invited to play a positive role in developing values. Likewise, political leaders should take part and make great effort to decrease injustice. Leaders should look to obtain solutions for enduring problems, even if they are not conclusive or perfectly fair, as solving matters through military means is simply immoral.\nWe would recommend the three following goals to achieve a better balance in society’s values:\n1. Deliver lectures about values to convince Europeans, particularly the Muslim youth,  to prevent them from falling into terrorism and crime.\n2. Ask the concerned authorities in the West to give the Muslim youth their due rights, especially their cultural rights, so that they become a positive factor with their specific characteristics that do not contradict the main values of European society.\n3. Inviting the West to reconsider its relationship with the Muslim world in light of such values to bring about a more agreeable coexistence for all.

      "Question": "Combining Maghrib and `Isha’ in Scandinavian Countries",
      "Answer": "\nWe have a problem in the Scandinavian countries that we suffer in summer concerning `Isha’ Prayer. In the Scandinavian countries we, Muslims, have predetermined times for Prayers. But in the summer, `Isha Prayer is so late and this causes a great problem. For example, Maghrib Prayer is at 21:50 while `Isha’ Prayer is at 1:00 am. Each mosque applies this in its own way. In some mosques they combine Maghrib and `Isha, and in some others they pray `Isha an hour and half after Maghrib, while others wait until its 1:00 am. Will you make it clear which is better? May Allah bless you.\nAll praise is due to Allah. May the peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah. We know that the times of twilight cause a problem in Northern Europe, because the sun sometimes does not even set. Thus, the issue is broad. This can be summarized in the following points: 1) Muslims there can combine `Isha with Maghrib, 2) they can set some time between Maghrib and Fajr to pray `Isha, which is better, 3) if there is any hardship, they can combine the two Prayers, because combining them for one who is resident was permitted by some scholars. Imam Ahmad permitted this for a suckling woman, if it is difficult for her to perform each Prayer individually. A group of scholars also permitted it, such as Ibn Sireen and Ashhab, according to one of his two opinions. It is also the opinion of Ibn Habeeb from among the Malikites. All these scholars permitted combining Prayers without an excuse. Ibn `Arafah, a Malikite scholar in the eighth century, said: One of our sheikhs would combine prayers when he wanted to go to the hammam (public hot bath). The basic evidence in this regard is the authentic hadith reported by Muslim (705) and others that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) combined Prayers without being in conditions of fear or on travel. In another narration: without being in conditions of fear or in times of rain. Ibn `Abbas was asked why he (the prophet (peace be upon him)) did that? He said: So as not to cause hardship for his ummah. This is the basic evidence with regard to combining the Prayers. The important thing is that this should not be a habit. If people combine Prayers for these reasons of hardship and necessity, particularly those who have jobs in the morning, this will be permissible and involve nothing wrong, but with the condition that this ought not to be a habit, in the sense that from time to time one should perform such Prayers in their due times.

      "Answer": "\n What is the ruling on a man called Al-Luhaidi who posts online alleging to be Mahdi? Is his allegation true or not? Please enlighten us, may Allah bless you.\nThis man is most probably a liar. He is claiming a status that he does not have. The true Mahdi is elaborately described in the books of the People of Sunnah. He is a righteous man who will come at the end of time to be the Imam of Muslims and will lead them in Prayer when `Isa (peace be upon him) descends and prays behind him.\nIf that man claims to be mahdi (Arabic of guided) in the sense that he guides people to the Truth, and if he is an evidently pious scholar who is knowledgeable of the Qur’an and Sunnah and following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), then may Allah let him be a guide for others.\nBut if the intended meaning here is the narrations documented in the books of Sunnah (some of which are true but implicit, and some explicit but untrue — all indicating that there will come at the end of time a righteous man who will do great deeds, including leading Muslims in Prayer, upon the descending of `Isa), such signs are most likely not found in that man. Signs and features of Al-Mahdi are described in detail in the book At-Tadhkirah (The Reminder) by Al-Qurtubi and other books, many of which are inauthentic though, as already said. Therefore, such claim is mostly false. And Allah, the Almighty, knows best.\n\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Answer": "\nI am a young man who is in the habit of checking his garment to make sure they are pure. When I find stains, I am not sure whether they are drops of urine or other stains. At one point I decided to see a physician, however, after making Istikharah, I did not go, but I am still worried. Is it permissible for me to make Istikharah if I doubt my purity? Please answer me, may Allah reward you with good!\nPraying Istikharah is always a good thing. Yet, Istikharah is offered regarding permissible matters and not obligatory, desirable, prohibited or undesirable matters. Obligatory and desirable matters are done without offering Istikharah, just as undesirable and prohibited matters are avoided without offering Istikharah. As for the inquirer, he seems to be always in doubt and he needs to ignore these ideas. He may follow the opinion of Imam Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) who says that sprinkling the garment with water eliminates the effect of any stains of urine. All you have to do is to sprinkle your garment with water. This view is adopted by Imam Ahmad as well. The basic ruling of objects is that they are pure. Thus, the garment is pure unless you are certain it is not.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Christians in the Hereafter!!",
      "Answer": "\n In the Name of Allah, peace be upon you. My question is: What is the ruling of Mushriks or the people of the book who receive the message of Islam but do not join Islam? And what is the ruling of those who do not receive the message of Islam? Similarly, what is the ruling of Christians who admit Allah is One but follow the religion of `Isa (Jesus, peace be upon him)? Will they be among the dwellers of Paradise or the denizens of Hell? Enlighten us, may Allah reward you with good!\nAllah, Glorified be He, says: “And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.” (Al-`Imran, 3:85) The Prophet (peace be upon him) stressed the same ruling by saying that any Jew or Christian who heard about him and did not follow him would be among the denizens of Hell. This is related by Muslim (153) on the authority of Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him). Anyone who receives the message of Islam and does not enter Islam will not be saved from the punishment of Allah; he will enter the Hell. Allah, Praised be He, says: “…this Qur’an has been revealed to me that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach.” (Al-An`am, 6:19) The message of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) nullifies all previous messages, for he is the final Messenger and his message prevails over all messages. That is what we believe. Other rulings are based on this ruling. For example, a Muslim can deal with these people to benefit the Muslims or keep them safe from any harm. This has nothing to do with their belief, for every person with a certain belief thinks he is on the right path. It would not be called belief if he did not think so. This is what makes our belief in Islam firm. As for those who do not receive the message, they take the same ruling as the people who lived in the interval between the prophets. Scholars have two opinions regarding them: First: As far as the basics of Islam are concerned, they are punished, but this is not so concerning subsidiary matters. Many scholars such as Al-Qarafi adopt this opinion. The author of Maraqi Al-Su`ud says: “The people who lived in the interval between two prophets are not held accountable for subsidiary matters, but scholars differ concerning the basics.” Such people are not required to fulfill subsidiary matters but they are required to follow the principles of Shari`ah; which is to believe in Allah, His angels, books, messengers and the Last Day. But scholars differ in this regard. An example of such a person is someone who lived on an island and did not hear anything of Muhammad’s message. Anyone who did not receive the message takes the same ruling. On the Day of Judgment, he may be resurrected and given the choice, as mentioned in the Hadith related by Ibn Kathir. Thus, the matter is subject to many criteria discussed by scholars (may Allah be merciful to them all).\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Charitable Organizations Are Indispensable",
      "Answer": "\nCharitable organizations are such organizations that foster charitable activities in an organized and voluntary way, with ethical and non-profit motives. These are the features and characteristics that distinguish charitable organizations from governmental institutions of social solidarity and other society-service organizations.\nServices provided by charitable organizations aim at the general welfare of humanity. They provide help for the poor and the needy, healthcare for the sick, condolences for the aged, housing for the indigents, schools for the students of knowledge, and workshops for unemployed persons to work at or dedicate endowments to encourage scholars and scientific discoveries. These activities, in addition to the role of the governments, are indispensable in civilized societies to face the necessary needs of the society and its development.\nThis introduction is necessary to understand the role of charitable organizations in general. As for charitable organizations in Islam, they are inseparable parts of the Muslim community because they are deeply rooted in its heritage, values and principles. Thus, charitable institutions are indispensable due to the reasons discussed herewith.\nThe Value of Charities\nMuslims are committed individually and collectively by an explicit Qur’anic text to give part of their wealth in charity every year. This wealth may be in the form of trade, agriculture, animals, or metals. Almighty Allah says: “And those in whose wealth there is a known right, for the beggar who asks and for the unlucky who has lost his property and wealth.” (Al-Ma’arij70:24-25) As such, charitable giving is a duty, rather than just a voluntary act.\nZakah is the third pillar of Islam, after the testimony of the Oneness of Allah and the performance of Prayer. This is the first thing that those who question the role of these organizations have to understand. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and his Companions applied this by establishing endowments for the benefit of the needy and wayfarers. Malik (may Allah have mercy with him) said: “These are their endowments (indicating to their endowments in Medina.)”\nMuslims have followed their example throughout history. There have been a variety of endowments thereafter; and with their funds great universities and hospitals were established to take care of orphans, widows and the destitute. This is well-documented in Islamic history and Europeans knew of endowments through their contact with Muslims in the Middle Ages. Such a provision for the needy in Islam has created a relationship of solidarity between the rich and poor classes of society. This has historically driven away the ghost of revolution, which continues to plague other societies that fail to give due attention to charitable activities.\nCharitable deeds have deep roots in the Islamic history and have been an element of stability and equilibrium in Islamic society. As charitable organizations work in full transparency and deal with the public, they can never deviate from their course; just as good cannot turn to evil. Such trustworthy organizations add value to a stable society.\nCharitable organizations in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as well as in other countries, have undertaken promising services for the benefit of Muslims and non-Muslims. These services include curing the sick, teaching the ignorant, arranging workshops for the unemployed and cooperating with Western charitable organizations that attest to their success in the field of humanitarian work in Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Africa.\nIt is worth mentioning here that such humanitarian services are still unfortunately subject to suspicion on the basis of racial prejudice. Arguably if an individual in society goes astray, it is that individual who should be held responsible for their actions. However, in the current climate, all Islamic organizations (charitable included), and indeed the whole Muslim nation or Islam itself, is being held responsible for the acts of the few. This ‘quick to generalize’ attitude cannot be anything but unjust, because it is not based on accurate information. It is just a form of conjecture and surmise that practices the habit of impugning Islam and Muslims, conducted by organizations that have unambiguous and identifiable goals and ends.\nThe Muslim response to such conjecture should not be to cut back in charitable activities or to shun goodness, but instead we should form charitable institutions of obvious and constructive goals that benefit the society. Initiatives such as Prince Abdullah’s charitable institution for the provision of suitable housing and Prince Sultan’s city for humanitarian services give the practical response to the unjust campaign against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nWe must ask, how can Islamic charitable activities be under such scrutiny and accusation from the West whose effective leader, the United States of America, itself brags about its pioneering role in charitable activity? In 1989 charitable institutions grew to over 32,000 institutions with assets of 137 billion dollars. Rockefeller 1902, Karnigy 1906, Ford 1936, and Johnson 1936 are just some of the ancient institutions that engage in different fields of humanitarian activities including education, health care and preaching. The US federal government encourages these global institutions by exempting them from taxes, yet fails to place any basic trust in international Islamic charities.\nIt cannot be denied that charitable activities and institutions are indispensable. Contrary to any rumors, they provide elements of stability and balance. Moreover, they are a kind of worship and a translation of the message of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) that has come to worship the True God through the true religion and to establish mercy with people. Hence, these institutions should keep working actively in full transparency and unambiguous clarity so as to prove to the whole world the originality of charitable activities in these and other Muslim countries. We must remove ourselves from any doubts and false accusation of terrorism that sham propaganda perpetuates, not only against charitable institutions but also against Islam itself.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Celebrating the National Day",
      "Answer": "\nIs it permissible to attend the National Day celebration? If I am obliged to attend the celebration – as an employee in the embassy – what should I do? Can I attend with the intention of giving a religious talk, advising people to obey Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him)? Please guide me what to say because the celebration date is approaching and I do not know how to answer the ambassador’s wife if she invites me.\nThe National Day is not a day of `Id. It is just an occasion when people gather to celebrate something, like celebrating marriage or a newborn. This is not a religious `Id and we have to clarify this difference, which many people do not understand. Based on their misunderstanding, they may cause others to have doubts in their religion and to feel as if they are committing a major sin by celebrating an occasion. It is not a sin and the basic ruling of all things is permissibility. There is no harm to attend this celebration. The Maliki School of jurisprudence deemed it undesirable to eat from `Atira (a sacrifice offered by the pre-Islamic people during the month of Rajab), while the Hanbali School deemed it permissible, since there is no text prohibiting it. People during the pre-Islamic times used to slaughter an animal in the month of Rajab. It was called Rajabiyyah or `Atira. Some scholars are of the opinion that it is permissible, based on the basic ruling. If people gather and slaughter an animal during Rajab or Sha`ban, or at any time, there is no harm in this. Similarly, if people celebrate an occasion, such as their independence or the National Day, which is common in African countries, there is no harm in this. It is also good that you can give a religious talk to the people. On the other hand, when the Prophet (peace be upon him) told us that Muslims have only two `Ids: `Idul-Adha and `Idul-Fitr, this does not mean that he forbade people from gathering. These celebrations are not prohibited, even if you hate attending them, as long as they involve no evil. Thus, there is no need to disturb people and spread doubts regarding matters that are not prohibited according to the Qur’an, Sunnah, Ijma`, or the agreement of scholars in the same Madhhab. It is better to take the more lenient of the two opinions in such cases as these which have no conclusive evidence. Leniency and ease is among the principles of this religion. Allah says: “He has… not laid upon you in religion any hardship.” (Al-Hajj, 22:78) He also says: “Allah wishes to lighten (the burden) for you.” (Al-Nisa’, 4:28) And He says: “So verily, with hardship, there is (more than one) relief, verily, with hardship, there is (more than one) relief (i.e. there is one hardship with two reliefs, so one hardship cannot overcome two reliefs).” (Al-Sharh, 94:5-6) The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Make things easy (for people) and do not make things difficult, give glad tidings and do not put people off.” Related by Al-Bukhari (69) and Muslim (1734) on the authority of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him). So, the basic ruling in this religion is to make things easy for people. The opinions of other scholars are respected, but they are not equal to the judgment of Allah. Peace be upon you.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Can Man Prevent His Wife from Working?",
      "Answer": "\nCan a man prevent his wife from working, knowing that he agreed to marry her after he knew that she worked as a teacher. What is the ruling for this case according to the Malikite school or according to ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream)?\nAll praise is due to Allah. Peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessing be upon him), upon his family and his companions. And upon you be peace, together with the mercy and blessings of Allah. First, we say to the questioner that the Malikite  school is not foreign to ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama`ah. Imam Malik is a leading scholar among ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama`ah. Hence, there are not two separate opinions; one according to Malik and the other according to ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama`ah. As for the wife’s work, the basic principle is that the husband has guardianship over his wife provided that he can afford her provision and needs. Therefore, according to Malik and al-Shafi`i, who are from ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama`ah, if he cannot afford this, his guardianship is not complete and hence she can ask for a divorce. On the other hand, Abu Hanifah views that such a provision remains as a debt on the husband. Thus, one can prevent his wife from working if he can provide her needs. But for me – and I am one of ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama`ah – it seems that the issue refers to customs and the individuals concerned. I n some places, if the wife is prevented from work and remains at home, this will be a reason for great inconvenience and for more evils. Accordingly, the issue should be weighed up according to the benefits and evils. Women among the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) worked. Asma’, wife of al-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with him), worked. She provided fodder for the watering-camel of al-Zubayr, as reported in an authentic hadith. [See al-Bukhary (5224) and Muslim (2182)] Another woman was told to stop working on her palm-trees as she was in her waiting period, but the Prophet (peace and blessing be upon him) said to her, “Reap your palm-trees.” This is an authentic hadith [See al-Musannaf by `Abd al-Razzaq (7:25)]\nThus, work for women is not something new. It is something known in Islam and hence we should be broadminded in this regard. It is true that the husband has guardianship over his wife as the head of the family. In the Islamic Shari`ah, things have to be under control. “No three persons should travel without having one person as a chief.” [See al-Bayhaqy (9:359) and al-Musannaf by `Abd al-Razzaq (4:58)] Thus, in order to keep order and discipline, the husband is the person who is the chief. But this does not mean that he may do or say whatever he wants. Rather, the household is arranged according to his counsel. Almighty Allah commands that the two spouses should consult one another with regard to weaning their child, “But if both [parents] desire to wean [the child], by their mutual consent and consultation.” [2:233] How much more, then, should be the case with regard to her own affairs? In short, if he commands her to do something that does not contradict the Shari`ah, she has to obey him, but he is not permitted to command her to do something that leads to evil or to losing some benefit. But if her work will lead to mingling with men or to other evil consequences, he has the right to command her to leave it and she has to obey him. This is the answer according to the position of Malik and the majority of scholars.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Can a Qur’an Teacher Accept Gifts?",
      "Answer": "\nI have a sister who works in Islamic Da`wah, in particular teaching Qur’anic intonation and recitation. She lives in an Arab country where people appreciate teachers, and she is  respected much there because she teaches something related to religion. Once, a ceremony was held as a tribute to her, and she was offered a gift, but she strongly refused to accept it. Was she right in her refusal?\nAll praise is due to Allah, and peace and prayer be upon the Messenger of Allah. It seems that this Muslim sister is too pious. Accepting a gift offered by a certain body, not a person, is acceptable in Islamic Shari`ah, based on the authentic hadith in which the Prophet says, “The worthiest thing to receive a wage for is (teaching) the Book of Allah” [Sahih Al-Bukhari, 5737]. This hadith is cited by the three imams, Malik, Ash-Shafi`i, and Ahmad, to prove the permissibility of accepting payments for teaching the Qur’an. There is a widely known hadith that emphatically prohibits accepting any recompense in return for teaching the Qur’an. The clearest evidence on prohibition is the hadith reported by Ubay Ibn Ka`b (may Allah be pleased with him), who said, “I taught a man (some of) the Qur’an, and subsequently, he gave me a bow. When I mentioned this to the Messenger of Allah, he said to me, ‘If you take it, you will be taking a bow of fire’. So, I returned it” [Ibn Majah, 2158]. Al-Bayhaqi and Ibn `Abdul-Barr deemed it “disconnected”, while some Qur’anic scholars disagreed with them. After all, this hadith remains controversial, and scholars retorted that it is either abrogated or has a special interpretation, on the grounds that the man had no other teacher, and thus, this (the obligation to teach him Qur’an was) was an individual, not collective, obligation. This is proved by the hadith in which the Prophet gave `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) money and said to him, “Whatever Allah gives you from it without begging or pursuit, then take it” [Sahih Al-Bukhari, 1473; Sahih Muslim, 1045; Sunan An-Nasa’i, 2605]. There is another hadith that reads, “Exchange gifts with one another so that love increases among you” [Narrated by Al-Bukhari in Al-Adab Al-Mufrad (Unique Literature), 594]; Abu Ya`la, 6013; and Al-Bayhaqi in Ash-Shu`ab (the Branches), 8693]. This indicates that exchanging presents promotes cordiality. So, we think it would be better for her to accept the gift, and if she is still uncertain, she can then give it away in charity. Also, she should be courteous with her colleagues, as Islam urges kindness and good manners and criticizes harshness. May Allah reward her well for her piousness and fear of falling into doubtful matters. But still, she should be more insightful with respect to her religion. And Allah knows best.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Can I Marry My Cohabitant?",
      "Answer": "\nI have an unmarried younger brother who had illicit sexual intercourse with an unmarried girl. He wants to marry her for one month and then divorce her. He also wants her to take the contraceptive injection for one year so that their affair should not be discovered, a matter that will cause undesirable results. I know that there is a difference of opinion over the ruling of marrying a woman who had illicit sexual intercourse and over the ruling of marrying with the intention of divorce. Should we give preponderance to divorce in this case, weighing up the benefits and harms? Those who are concerned agree that there is some benefit – in order to conceal their  affair and not to cause problems for her – if he should marry her for a certain period of time away from the family, and then divorce her. What do you advise?\n All praise is due to Allah. Peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah. The issue is controversial, but the principle is that it is permissible to marry a woman who had illicit sexual intercourse, though scholars differed over the necessity of her repentance. There is also a difference of opinion concerning the issue of seeking the clarity of her womb; that is, whether it is permissible to marry her before seeking the clarity of her womb with one period, or having to wait until after this. This is a controversial issue. Al-Shafi`i and Abu Hanifah maintained that it is permissible to marry her before seeking the clarity of her womb. Imam Ahmad and Malik maintained that it is a must to seek the clarity of her womb first, but they differed whether this should be with one or three instances of menstruation. This opinion is based on the hadith that reads “He who believes in Allah and in the Last Day shall not water the seeds of someone else (a figurative expression for having sex with a woman who might have conceived from a previous sexual relation.)” [Reported by Abu Dawud (2158) and al-Termidhy (1131).] But in this case the seed is his. Thus, he may marry her. But it will be more proper to wait until she menstruates. `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) wanted to marry a woman to a man who had illicit sexual relation with her after he had applied the prescribed penalty on them. This is an authentic report (see al-Musannaf by Ibn Abu Shaybah 3:52; Sunan al-Bayhaqi 7:155; al-Muhalla 10:28;  Mawsu`at Fiqh `Umar ibn al-Khattab, p.649-50.) Therefore, I see that he may marry this woman to conceal their past affair and that he should ask her to repent to Allah, the Almighty. As for the intention to divorce her, if he does not pronounce it at the time of concluding the marriage and they have not mutually agreed on this, it will have no effect, according to the majority of the scholars. He can marry her with the intention of divorcing her provided that such an intention should not be included in the marriage contract by saying something like “I marry you for such and such period of time”. Such an inclusion will make it a sort of the unlawful temporary marriage. However, before the marriage he should demand her to repent; and when he perceives her repentance, he may marry her. He also should not state a time limit for the marriage when concluding it. Then, he may divorce her whenever he likes. What he will do in the future is not to be taken into consideration in this regard. Moreover, he, together with the family of this woman, should admonish her to fear Allah, the Almighty. Nevertheless, should he intend to continue the marriage with her, this will be better. Perhaps Almighty Allah will amend their affairs and guide them to make up for what they spoiled in the past by making sincere repentance to Him, as illustrated in the hadith that reads “He who repents from a sin is like the one who committed no sin.” [reported by Ibn Majah (4250) with a good chain of narrators.]\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Buying a Computer by Installments",
      "Answer": "\nGreetings. I need your opinion on a matter that worries me a lot. I work as a maintenance technician, and I want to buy a computer to help me in my work, but I do not have enough cash, as my salary is not enough and I am already repaying a debt. So, I am thinking of buying it by installments, but this means I will pay more than its current price. Is this extra sum a form of usury if both parties (the seller and I) are accepting this?\nAnother point: I want a standard definition for usury, to apply it to different cases I come across in my life. For example, I want to furnish my home to get married, but I cannot afford this in cash, and no furniture seller would accept to sell something by installments at the same original price. I am also thinking of taking a bank loan to start my own business, build a house for marriage, etc. Kindly clarify the ruling to me soon on the urgent question of buying a computer. May Allah reward you with good.\nThe question includes three points, as follows:\n1. Purchasing a computer by installments that cover the price and an interest margin: This sale is permissible, and there is no impediment to it in Shari`ah, as judged by majority of Muslim scholars. Allah says, {But Allah permits commerce and forbids usury}. In deferred sale, there is no difference between delaying the whole payment and paying it in installments.\n2. Definition of usury: Usury have several types, as `Umar Ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said. Scholars differed on whether it refers to “every invalid sale” or “any interest charged on loans (Riba An-Nasi’ah) or the extra value incurred when exchanging two things of the same kinds (Riba Al-Fadl). The most common type of usury these days is the interests charged on bank loans, by which the principal generates an extra with no goods or services transacted in between, which is impermissible in Shari`ah. This also answers your third question about your intention to borrow an interest-laden sum of money from a bank.\n\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "“Boss Refuses to Let Me Attend Friday Prayers.”",
      "Answer": "\nThe Question:\nMy husband works for a company in London. Recently he asked his boss if he would excuse him on Fridays to observe the Friday Prayer. His boss refused and my husband is unable to observe it. What is the ruling on one in this situation? Is there any action that can be done to make up for missing this prayer?\nThe Answer: \nThe Friday prayer is an obligation according to the Qu’ran and the Traditions of the Prophet [May Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him].\nThe Qur’an states: “Oh you who profess faith! When you are called to the prayer on they day of congregation [Friday], rush to the remembrance of Allah and leave off [all forms of] commerce: this is better for you, if you but knew.” The Qur’an 62:9\nThe Prophet Muhammad [May Allah’s peace and blessings be upon him] cautioned leaving the Friday Prayers [without a valid excuse] stating that one who abandoned three Friday prayers, “Allah will seal his/her heart.” Thus, [this makes it clear] that observing the Friday prayer is an obligatory action.\nHowever, if we look at this issue regarding this woman’s husband, we must do so from the perspective that he is unable to find another means of employment unless he works with this person. Therefore, it is likely that he is excused [for missing the Friday prayer]; conditioned that he is not able to find another job. So, [under these conditions], he is excused for missing the Friday prayers and should pray four rakat’s until he finds another place to work.\nThis is what is apparent to us regarding this situation based on the order of benefits and harms, that the Friday prayer has a replacement [the noon prayer] and that the scholars allowed one to miss the Friday prayers due to hail, heavy rain, illness, weakness and so on. Please refer to Imam Khalil al-Maliki’s explanation in his book where he wrote: “Excuses for missing it [the Friday prayer]: extreme mud, rain, leprocy, the sick and the one engaged in nursing the weak/ill” and this issue falls under the above.\nAllah Knows best\nDr. ‘Abdullah Bin Bayyah\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Boycott of the Danish Company – Arla",
      "Answer": "\nDr. Abdullah ibn al-Mahfouz ibn Bayyah, former Mauritanian justice minister and vice chairman of the International Union of Muslim Scholars, was asked about his opinion concerning ending boycott of Arla, a Danish company, as recommended by the conference held in Bahrain. He answered:\nAll praise is due to Allah. Peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah and upon all his Companions. I see that the boycott should be lifted of this company. I expressed this point of view in a conference held in Bahrain that combined scholars, intellectuals, and researchers. It is based on the following reason:\n1.                  The general principle stated in the Quranic verse “And no laden soul shall carry the load of another”. The other verse in the chapter of al-Najm reads “Or is it that he has not been told of what was in the Scriptures of Moses and of Abraham- who proved ever true [to his Lord’s word: That no laden soul shall carry the load of another; and that there is nothing for a person except that for which he strives.” This principle is found in all heavenly legislations and in all human laws. 2.                  I believe that the apology presented by the company, along with its renouncement of what these people did, is enough, when added to the first reason, to lift boycott of this company.\n3.                  Taking interests into consideration, we should deal with reasonable persons who desire to build good relations and treatments. We should deal with them equally and should stretch our hands to those who stretch their hands to us. The basic principle in the relations is to have kind and equitable treatment with those who do not fight us or launch war against us- be it verbal or military war. Almighty Allah says “Allah does not forbid you from [honorable relations with] those who have not fought you over religion, nor expelled you from your dwellings- that you relate kindly and equitably with them. Indeed, Allah loves those who are just.” This company did not do harm against us and consequently, it deserves our kind and equitable treatment.\n4.                    Forgiving, pardoning, tolerance, and kind treatment are values and principles beyond doubts in Islam. \nThrough our conduct and behavior and through stretching our hands to others we can embody these values. Conversely, through our improper conduct we may cause tremendous harms to our interest and our call to Islam which is a call to peace, love, and cordiality. I believe that this attitude is the appropriate one that helps Muslims’ need to create public opinion that deals with the West. If we are to reject every hand stretched to us, this will mean that we will unconsciously provoke others against us, which will be short-sidedness.  I believe that this will cause tremendous harm to our interests and will provoke people against us; and thus our call will not reach others and our words will not be listened to. Thus, the interest is to stretch our hands to them. Finally, I prefer that lifting the boycott should be on the basis of a meeting held between this company and the general secretariat of the conference. This meeting can reach a binding agreement based on some conditions declared by the company that may help in changing the typical image that the West has. This is my opinion. Almighty Allah is the One who says the truth and guides to the right path. Almighty Allah knows best.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Beyond Good &#038; Evil",
      "Answer": "\nWhen discussing the meaning, role, and limits of reason, it is important to highlight a major, long-standing issue related to both religion and reason: the issue of Divine Will, good and evil, and Divine Nature. In this series of articles, we will discuss such aspects in some detail.\nThis is a philosophical and metaphysical issue that cannot be measured quantitatively. Of course, a believer in heavenly revelation and Prophethood differs with others on the perspective to it. All believers in heavenly messages believe in a realm that is beyond rational categorization but is recognized as inevitable in light of the fact of existence. This is the Inevitably Existent, of Whom everything is in need but Who is in need of nothing. This is the Everlasting Who, for us Muslims, cannot be subject to the laws governing created beings, as such laws are not a valid basis for comparison due to dissimilarity, let alone similarity. This is the meaning of: {And He has no match whatsoever}. The scope of reason here is limited to impossibility and inevitability: It is impossible that the universe exists without Him, and it is inevitable that He exists.\nExisting creatures were originally nonexistent, and the coming of the nonexistent into existence logically entails an originator. In addition, engineering creatures so delicately and orderly requires that such originator is all-wise, all-able, and all-cognizant. This is the inevitable conclusion of sound minds that understand that nonexistence cannot originate existence, that haphazardness cannot originate orderliness, and that coincidence cannot originate delicate engineering. Allah says, {Or were they created by nothing or were they themselves the creators?} The attributes of that originator must be attributes of perfection, which belong to the sphere of inevitability, while their contraries belong to the sphere of impossibility. But heavenly revelation intervenes here to prove or deny what is established or denied by the mind.\nTherefore, contradiction is inconceivable between the mind and heavenly revelation. Imam As-Sayrafi, a prominent Shafi`i scholar, said, “It cannot happen that the Book, Sunnah, or Muslim consensus come with something unacceptable to the mind. With this in mind, every act of worship stated in the Qur’an or Sunnah either (1) seconds the approval or disapproval by the mind (such as requiring thankfulness to Allah and prohibiting polytheism) or (2) brings forward something that is mentally neutral (such as Prayer and Zakah, which turned, by virtue of divine texts, from fifty-fifty possibility into utter obligation). Religious texts fall only under one of these two categories. The evidence that the mind can judge what is received through religious teachings is that it is authorized and assigned to distinguish between things”.\nAs we can see, there is no disagreement among scholars, whether rationally or religiously, ascribing all attributes of perfection to Allah, the One and Only. All His Acts and Commandments are an embodiment of truth, goodness, and beauty. Al-Amidi said, “There is an agreement that all Acts of Allah are good in every way and that all their contraries — untruth, evil, and ugliness — can never be His”.\nWhat is the meaning of good and evil? And what are their features?\nGood and evil are abstract, indefinite words. Good is whatever conforms to an ideal or moral though, virtue, justice, or interest; evil is the opposite of all such.\nCan a universal phenomenon be described as good or evil in any way? And relatively to what? Here, perplexity arises among those who lack insight. We will try to illustrate the concept of good and evil with some examples — though each has its own particularity.\nA farmer is burning the weeds in his field or slaughtering the diseased cattle. How do you see this? Contrarily, a vandal is burning others’ gardens or killing their animals — {Destroys crops and cattle} in the Qur’anic wording. How do you see this? The same act takes different responses depending on the intention and the doer.\nOther examples include a doctor who cuts the skin of a patient in a surgery to save his life, compared to a criminal who injures someone deeply, or a judge who sentences a criminal to imprisonment or death to protect society against his malice, versus a tyrant who kills people with fighters and missiles. It depends on the motive and aim of killing, but it depends also on our perception of good and evil. In the next article, we will continue to discuss the criteria for good and evil as held by Muslim scholars as well as others.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Avoiding General Invocations against Non-Muslims",
      "Answer": "\nSheikh Abdullah Bin Bayyah, former Mauritanian Justice and Endowment Minister, and Professor of Islamic Studies at King Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah, expressed his objection to general invocations against non-Muslims. He asserted that the Islamic Shari`ah (Islamic law) enjoins us to consider the consequences of our deeds, words, and behaviors including supplications made from the pulpits of mosques.\nIt also forbids us to do anything that may stir enmity and dispute with non-Muslims. Sheikh Bin Bayyah quoted as evidence the prohibition of insulting idols before those who may be provoked by this, as the Qur’anic verse states: “And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allah, lest they insult Allah wrongfully without knowledge.” (Al-An’am 6:108)\nSheikh Bin Bayyah also stressed that Muslims’ supplication for themselves and their invocations against those who wrong and oppress them is a human inheritance that all nations share. The issue needs a balance of moderation that neither makes generalization, nor insults or provokes the other. But at the same time one should not feel subservient or humble before those who do not keep a covenant or treaty. This is what imams and callers to Islam should consider when they are standing at the pulpits of their mosques. Enthusiasm and ecstasy should not drive them to transgress the limits with regard to supplication, which is contrary to the Islamic values of tolerance, mercy, justice, and moderation.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

      "Question": "Bequeathing While in Death Bed",
      "Answer": "\nSomeone suffering from a fatal disease wishes to grant most of his inheritance to a certain group of his heirs, for he knows they are more in need compared to his other heirs. Is it permissible for him to grant huge amounts of his wealth to some heirs? Can he take an oral or written pledge from the other heirs to give up their shares?\nThe basic ruling, according to many scholars, is that a Muslim on his death bed cannot grant any of his wealth to anyone, for he is not legally competent at that time. In addition, it is not permissible for him to prefer some heirs to others. Yet, it is permissible for him to ask the rest of the heirs to give up some of their inheritance to the poorer ones. If the heirs comply after his death, it will be good and they will also be acting dutifully towards him, but if they do not, there is no harm on them because giving this gift is not binding as long as it was not received as such. It is a gift related to someone’s death, and thus it is not binding, unless the rich heirs wish to do it. In which case, it will be better and preferable. Only Imam Malik declares it is binding and believes it is permissible for the poor heirs to sue the richer ones for them (the poor) to receive this gift.

      "Question": "A Father Gifts Sons Without Daughters",
      "Answer": "\nA man gifted a spacious land that includes many farms to his sons, to the exclusion of his daughters. He was fully responsible and competent when he did this. After his death, the documents remained with his sons and they did not distribute them. Is it permissible for any of the partners to prevent the others from examining these documents and knowing their content?\nWhat this man did is not permissible, though some scholars regard this gift as having valid consequences. But the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) has prohibited unfair gifts. One must not be unfair with his children. When Bashir, father of al-Nu`man, asked the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) to bear witness to his gift, he said, “I do not bear witness to injustice.” It is not permissible to give gifts to some of his children to the exclusion of others. He should have distributed his property among his children according to their shares in inheritance. He could have given the male a double share of that of the female. There is nothing to disallow this. But it is not permissible to exclude the daughters totally. Therefore, if this case is taken to a Hanbilite judge, he will invalidate it. The Malikites and the Shafi`ites validate such a gift; but the Hanbilites do not, and this is closer to the text and more proper. As for the documents, all the heirs have a right to have them. Thus, the judge before whom the case is submitted should demand the heirs who possess these documents to bring them, because no one has the right to possess them to the exclusion of others.

      "Question": "A Muslim Has Doubts about His Religion!!",
      "Answer": "\nI have a Muslim friend who is not convinced with the religion. Whenever I have a discussion with him he says, “How do you know that Islam is the true religion? I need a realistic proof other than the old stories.” He is not convinced with my words. I want an answer from your eminence so that he might return to guidance. May you always be under the care of Allah!\nAnd upon you be peace, together with the mercy and blessings of Allah. This person is not a believer. He is rather one of those concerning whom Allah said, “And whose hearts have a doubt. Thus they waver in their doubt.” [9:45] We seek refuge with Allah from such a condition. As for convincing him, he should be directed to consider the miracles of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and to ponder on the open book of the universe, which includes all the creatures of this universe, and on the written Book, which is the readable revelation, and the miracles and clear verses it includes. Through this consideration and reflection he will, eventually, reach faith and will know that he was not created by no-one. Almighty Allah said, “Or were they created out of nothing? Or were they the creators [of themselves]? Or is it that they are the ones who created the heavens and the earth? Rather, they have no certainty.” [52:35-35] It is He who created man, “And [they (the signs) are all] within yourselves as well. Can you not see?” [51:21] and created the surrounding environment, including celestial bodies, heavens, the sun, the moon, the earth on which we live, the air we breathe and all the benefits of the earth. Of course, this Great Creator is not part of this universe. One who considers the miracles of the prophets that Allah gave them, including the miracles of the Seal of the prophets (peace and blessings be upon him), knows for sure that they are from Almighty Allah. The most important thing for this person is to consider the scientific miracles of the Quran and the Sunnah. Had the Quran been from other than Allah, it would not have included, for example, the phases of the embryo. Almighty Allah said, “Verily, We created man out of an extraction of mud. Then We made him a sperm-drop set in a well-established place. Then We created the sperm-drop into a clinging clot. Then We created the clinging clot into a morsel-like lump. Then We created, from the morsel-like lump, bones. Then We clothed the bones with flesh. Thus do We bring him forth as an entirely different creation. So blessed be Allah the best of creators.” [23:12-14] How could the Quran have talked so clearly and explicitly about these four phases that scholars came to know about only in contemporary time had it not been from other than Almighty Allah? Moreover, many of the verses of the Quran are related to the scientific miracles, such as the verse of sending down iron, “And We sent down iron in which there is a mighty force, and [in which there are] many benefits for all people.” [57:25] Scientifically, it has been proven that iron was not made in the earth but rather in another place. Also add to this the description of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) found in the old Scriptures and how he managed to amend souls and hearts, and to guide a misguided and lost nation. All these are miracles that he has to revise and consider. He needs to read the Quran and reflect on it, to attend scholars’ sessions, and to ponder on the past and the future of his life and on his destiny. We mention all this in brief; and if we wanted to explain all the miracles and verses, this would take a long time. This amount is enough. We advise this person to seek guidance from Almighty Allah, “Whomever Allah guides, then he is truly guided. But whomever He leaves to stray, then never shall you find for him any rightly guiding patron” [18:17] “Indeed, you cannot guide all those whom you love [to Islam]. Rather, it is Allah who guides whomever He so wills.” [28:56] Let him ponder on the verses of Almighty Allah and sit with scholars to ask them about the doubts of his heart. He should also review Dala’il al-Nubuwwah by al-Bayhaqy which is a book that contains many of the miracles of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him). About the origin of iron, he should consult the results of the scientific miracles of the Quran published by the Society of the Miracles of the Quran. Such results are many and leave no doubt that the Quran is not from a human being but rather from Almighty Allah. This is all we can say now. As I said, he should go and sit with scholars, pray to Almighty Allah, and ask His guidance.\n\n Original Source Link \n",

The second part of our trip involved meeting with British officials, including Britain’s attorney general and the Minister of State for Middle East and Commonwealth Affairs.\nI also held a symposium with senior officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, followed by a meeting at the headquarters of the British police (Scotland Yard). I was not brought there for being accused of a charge! (These were my words to Sir Ian Blair, the then head of the aforementioned body.) Upon meeting Sir Blair – not to be confused with Tony Blair, the former Prime Minister – I was left with the impression that he was quite a gentleman.\nI must emphasize here to the reader that I was not carrying intelligence information. I was in fact asked to lecture in a room in the House of Lords on the drafting of laws under Islamic law. A discussion followed on some of the legal opinions surrounding such laws, the issue of security and the covenant of Islam. I then visited an Anglican Church where we exchanged thoughts and came to an agreement on various issues.\nJust a few days after my trip to the UK, I was at a conference in Kuwait organized by the Ministry of Justice and Endowments, under the title “We and the Other”. The subject on which I was asked to submit a paper was the “Parameters and Mechanisms of Communication”. I provided valuable research in this regard, which highlighted the desire to find a formula of communication. On the occasion of the conference I, along with a group of scientists and intellectuals, met with His Highness the Amir of Kuwait and the Prime Minister. I have heard from many sources of the sincere desire to find mechanisms for communication, which ultimately means understanding and harmony between civilizations, to put an end to misunderstanding and its causes.\nSo, what is the relationship between my tour in Britain and the trip to Kuwait?  It is the desire to communicate. I realized that all the individuals I met, at various levels of society, have the same desire to find ways for communication. I say this about Kuwaitis without reservation. As for the British, it is well known that they are the example of wisdom and that their accumulative experience about the Islamic world does not need to be proven. Yet, I think that they have desire to explore other ways to communicate with the Islamic civilization. They deal with their fellow Muslims in a very civilized manner, in comparison to the treatment of other countries.\nThe question now begs, why is it necessary to search for communication? Communication means the interaction between two or more persons; that is to establish a material or spiritual link. Its first meaning in the dictionary is to establish a relationship with someone. In his bookThe Other Globalization, issued in February 2004, the French writer Dominique Walton draws attention to the fact that the media, for example, does not stand for communication. He states: “There is a difference between the verbs ‘tell and inform’ on the one part, and the verb ‘communicate’ on the other part. This is because the globalization of the media came to inform people of news; but did not make them communicate to understand each other better.”\nCommunication has become an inevitable necessity and a sacred duty. If seeking to communicate presupposes the existence of problems, obstacles to be overcome, or a misunderstanding that should be removed, then our response must be positive. Communication is necessary in this day and age to avoid the misinterpretation of history. Some of those who falsely construct history include culprits who supposedly belong to Islam, who create false constructs without consultation from the vast majority of Muslims.\nThus, these incidents have accumulated in an historical hatred between civilizations, resulting in grave incidents. The clash of cultures predicted by fortunetellers has come true, and soothsaying has turned into disaster with wars breaking out in more than one country. What is the origin of this misunderstanding or mistrust?  First, let us say: friction is natural between neighbors. This friction can turn into battles, as it has done around the Mediterranean Sea. Neighbors have travelled through this water barrier, or connector, to bring rise to approximately 3000 major battles over the years, as estimated by some researchers.\nThe advent of Islam came about in the seventh century as a powerful empire, both culturally and spiritually, between Europe, Africa and the borders of Asia. Verily, this and subsequent events that spread across the centuries (beginning with Islam entering the Levant to truncate the southern Mediterranean from the Roman Empire, the seizure of Andalusia and Islam entering Constantinople) made Islam the greatest enemy of the West. This ‘arch-enemy’ needed to be eradicated by all means: military, cultural, and by the use of weapons of insult or defamation.\nThese obscene words and abhorrent characteristics appealed to the so-called ‘Enlightened Writers’, such as Dante, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Voltaire, and others who drew a bad image for Islam and Muslims. This led to the breaking of the Crusades and Restoration Wars after the call of Pope Urban in 1059 A.C.  The fall of Andalusia at the end of the 15th century and the retreat of the Turkish army at the walls of Vienna in 1683 A.C. marked the beginning of Western colonialism. The rest of the story is well-known. It concluded with the establishment of the State of Israel in the heart of the Arab world, and subsequent events that continue to this day.\nAnother reason for this mistrust and breakdown in communication has been highlighted by some western writers, namely Marcel Bouzar. He calls it “the knot of relatives”, as our relatives are often the most difficult to understand.\n\n Original Source Link \n",
